          "Case 1 reports on a three-credit service-learning course titled ‘Promotion of Children and Adolescent Development’ (hereinafter called Children). This course was offered by Dr Yu Lu and her colleagues from the Department of Applied Social Sciences at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).\n\nThe course expected students to be able to\n\n\t • critically examine the different perspectives on child and adolescent development and apply these concepts to understand the needs and potential of underprivileged children and adolescents in the community;\n\t • integrate knowledge on child and adolescent development into real-life situations through service delivery;\n\t • apply discipline-specific knowledge and skills (such as engagement and communication skills with children and adolescents) to deal with complex issues in the service setting;\n\t • reflect on their roles and responsibilities both as professionals in their chosen discipline and as responsible citizens;\n\t • cultivate positive values and strengths orientation;\n\t • cultivate civic responsibilities and prosocial behaviours;\n\t • develop a sense of care and compassion towards other people, especially underprivileged children and adolescents in the community;\n\t • enhance their self-confidence, problem-solving and decision-making capabilities; and\n\t • enhance their social competence and interpersonal skills through collaboration with partners, partnered agencies, parents and service targets.\n\nThe Children course ran across two semesters: spring and summer. In the spring semester, students were required to complete a 10-hour online course on the basic concepts and practices of service learning. This included research on and the principles and concepts of service learning; its benefits for service users, the community, students and the university; ethical issues; effective teamwork; and problem-solving skills in service learning and reflection as a tool for learning discipline-specific concepts.\n\nIIn the spring semester, the course also included one lesson on the course content and three on theories related to the development of children and adolescents. Each lesson lasted for three hours and included:\n\n\t • lectures and seminars to provide discipline-specific knowledge, including developmental theories of child and adolescent development, the ecological model of human development, the positive youth development model and the strengths model of intervention;\n\t • seminars to enable students to equip themselves with project-specific skills, such as engagement and communication with children and adolescents, ways to promote their competence, assessment of child and adolescent development, generic service planning, delivery and evaluation; and\n\t • small group discussions and workshops in which students developed a few lessons for underprivileged children and adolescents and discussed moral and ethical issues, service delivery skills and classroom management, allowing them to develop their teamwork skills.\n\nIn the service activity workshops, the course instructors guided university students on designing instructional programmes and obtaining basic teaching skills. For example, one lesson focused on how to stimulate primary school pupils’ interest and motivation in learning and on strategies to engage them in classroom learning. The university students were free to choose specific teaching topics relevant to their experiences and interests.\n\nAfterwards, the students partook of a ten-day tour and completed a service-learning project in Shanghai, Hangzhou and Xi’an in mainland China. During the first two days of the trip, they made pre-service preparations, and the resulting service activities were then carried out in a primary school over the next five days. Once these concluded, the course instructors organised a sixth workshop to help students consolidate their learning. Upon returning to Hong Kong, the students were required to prepare a group presentation for their final workshop."

              "To run the Children course, PolyU cooperated with Zhejiang University in mainland China to launch service activities in a primary school in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. The primary school was set up by the local government mainly for migrant children born elsewhere in China whose parents were working in Hangzhou.\n\nThe PolyU students enrolled in the Children course travelled to Hangzhou during the summer semester and provided a five-day service activity in the primary school. They were mainly engaged in teaching activities intended for primary school pupils. During the service period, the Zhejiang University research students participated in classroom observation and after-class group discussions to share their observations and opinions.\n\nThe Children course emphasised rich and effective communication with the service partner. PolyU’s counterparts at Zhejiang University initially made contact with the primary school. After clarifying the cooperative intention and before meeting directly with partners at the primary school, the course instructors sent the service plan to the school principal for advice and suggestions. The service plan addressed the following questions:\n\t • What did PolyU plan to do?\n\t • Were PolyU’s expectations and proposed service arrangement reasonable?\n\t • In the opinion of the primary school, was it appropriate to execute this plan?\n\t • Could it be achieved in the current school environment?\n\t • What expectations of the primary school were held by PolyU and Zhejiang University regarding, for example, the topics and content to be taught by the university students?\n\nThe course instructors sought the opinions of the school partners about the following four themes: interesting science, health promotion, personal development and interesting daily English. The partners also explained their expectations of the thematic content and how much time would be assigned to each topic their corresponding proportions, and the instructors made revisions accordingly. After reviewing the service plan, the school partners accepted and recognised the concept of service learning, expressing confidence in the university students’ enthusiasm and attitude. Through this active communication, the school partners felt that they were respected. With a good understanding of the service details and recognition of their opinions, the partners were more willing to cooperate.\n\nDuring the service period, the collaborating parties had to handle conflicts and maintain a good understanding of each another. The PolyU instructors hoped that the university students would play a leading role in class management. Initially, the head teachers worried that the university students could not manage the class effectively, so they often entered the classrooms to intervene in the planned activities and discipline the schoolchildren. Whenever the head teachers appeared, the pupils would follow their instructions directly, thereby restricting the university students’ performance. During the learning process, the head teachers thought that the class was run too haphazardly, while the university students found the head teachers to be too strict.\n\nTo enhance mutual understanding, the PolyU course instructors invited the head teachers to participate in a reflective meeting every afternoon to share their observations and concerns. The university students also explained to the head teachers their interactive teaching methods and their views on the rather unruly class. With more understanding, the head teachers gradually intervened less often in the following year. During the preparation stage, the course instructors also guided the university students to understand the differences between the culture of their home and that of their hosts and expected them to try their best to seek assistance from the head teachers to complete their service activities as scheduled.\n\nAt the beginning of the third year, the collaboration smoothed. The head teachers finally showed confidence in the university students and no longer observed the class teaching every day. Rather, they met first with the university students to introduce the class information and the characteristics of the primary school pupils. The university students could easily make contact with the head teachers in their offices, if needed, in addition to their regular reflective meetings at the end of each service day. The collaboration model between the two parties was finally well established after this active communication and mutual adjustment process.\n\nWhen the service period ended, the PolyU instructors and the service partners in China maintained contact through different means.\n\n<b><i>Sharing students’ learning outcomes.</i></b> The primary school invited a local television station to film a graduation ceremony at the end of the service period to broadcast in a news segment. The school shared the information with the PolyU course instructors to use for teaching in the coming year. The PolyU instructors also shared videos and photos taken during the service period with the primary schools to demonstrate the progress and outcomes of the teaching activities and the reflective meetings.\n\n<b><i>Conference invitations. </i></b> The PolyU course instructors published a paper based on the data collected in the first year of the service-learning course, which was accepted for presentation at a conference. The service partners were also invited to attend, which helped to improve mutual understanding and contact between the two parties.\n\n<b><i>Establishing personal relationships.</i></b> At the same time, the project partners developed personal relationships and stayed in contact. Trusting collaborative relationships between the service partners were gradually established and sustained."

            text:
              "In the first year, around 40 students from PolyU participated in the Children course. Two course instructors jointly led the university students to Hangzhou. As a result of the positive learning experiences and student outcomes, the primary school expected that PolyU would continue to provide service activities in the second year and was willing to develop a long-term cooperative partnership. Therefore, PolyU organised two classes with around 80 students in the following year, along with two more course instructors and one project assistant. In sum, a total of five colleagues (four course instructors and one project assistant) travelled with 80 university students to Hangzhou. The four course instructors provided guidance to the university students, while the project assistant was responsible for handling administrative matters. The university students formed teams of four and five, with each serving around 20 primary school pupils. The number of school pupils also increased from around 200 in the first year to around 400 in the second year.\n\nThis increase in class size presented the collaborating parties with new challenges. The primary school required more support, for example, with handling meals and maintaining hygiene. Other problems arose simultaneously. When the pupils faced problems, they usually approached the school principal or head teachers for help instead of first discussing the issue with the university students leading their classes. For example, when lunch boxes were delivered late to one class while the pupils from other classes had already begun eating, some pupils cried and sought out the principal directly.\n\nThe increase in class size also caused more accidents, even among course instructors. On one occasion, one instructor had an urgent health issue and had to return to Hong Kong early. The remaining course instructors then had to reallocate manpower in a short period of time. Thereafter, the class size was held at two large groups of 80, which were then broken into four smaller groups of 20 pupils each. This class size was more suitable for course instructors to observe and supervise."

          "At the time of design of service activities, the Children course instructors paid close attention to ensure that the university students had opportunities to apply the knowledge acquired in class to the activities arranged for the service targets. If the curriculum and planned activities were out of sync, the students found the classroom lessons to be useless and the service activities to be no different from ordinary volunteering.\n\nTo enhance the links between the curriculum and the planned services, in the spring semester, the course instructors introduced the characteristics of children and adolescents at different stages of their development. The students had the opportunity to develop appropriate topics for the group’s teaching plan using the theories they had acquired during the lessons. For example, when the university students learned that pupils in middle childhood were prone to accidents, they specifically chose to teach ‘furniture safety’ within the rubric of ‘health promotion’ to help the schoolchildren better protect themselves at home.\n\nAnother objective of the course was to develop the students’ teamwork abilities. Accordingly, the university students formed different groups, with each leading the service activities for 20 primary school pupils. Team members took turns to guide the children to participate in discussions and activities with the support of other team members, which served to enhance the university students’ abilities in teamwork, collaboration and communication.\n\nBeyond the design phase, the course instructors attached great importance to connecting with the course content when leading reflections and discussion in the day-end meetings. The university students were guided to respect the individual differences and diversity of the children they taught. In the practical teaching process, the students often encountered different levels of learning performance amongst their pupils. For example, some primary school children showed a high aptitude for learning English, but others only reached the beginner level. The PolyU instructors provided specific advice on how to design tiered learning tasks and different levels of worksheets based on the children’s abilities. At the same time, the instructors guided university students to understand individual differences and diversity in the growth of children and adolescents."

They met the principal and teachers from the school to equip themselves with general knowledge about the school and the characteristics of the schoolchildren.\n\nAdditionally, the course instructors paid considerable attention to analysing the characteristics and behaviours of the schoolchildren when interacting with the university students in the daily reflective activities. In the case of more rebellious pupils, they explored the causes of such behaviours, how their negative emotions were generated and other aspects. This exploration was very helpful for university students in terms of deepening their understanding of the characteristics of primary school pupils."

Through their direct interactions with the schoolchildren, the university students were expected to develop passion for caring for the children and showing empathy. For example, one of Dr Yu’s students shifted from readily disliking children to actively helping them. Although the student found that children were sincere but sometimes annoying, she later joined a tour to Africa to aid more children."

For example, the course instructors had designed for lecture themes on interesting science, health promotion, personal development and interesting daily English. The university students could select their teaching topics from the four themes based on their own experiences and interests. The instructors would encourage students to select those themes related to their major study. For example, students whose major was in marketing and finance could choose to teach the primary school children how to manage their pocket money. Meanwhile, the instructors would organize workshops and helped the students to equip with teaching skills, such as how to engage primary school students in activities and how to improve their learning motivation.\n\nThe university students would also discuss with the instructors their lesson plans. With the guidance of the instructors, the students would adjust their teaching plans taking into consideration the development level of the primary school students and the different learning context of Mainland China.\n\nAfter they prepared their teaching plans, the university students discussed with the instructors how suitable the plans were for the development level of the schoolchildren and whether the content could be presented in mainland China. For example, the Children class covered knowledge about physical development. Based on the learning needs of the upper primary school pupils, the university students planned to explore topics about sex education. The instructors then explained to the university students the social background of mainland China and the general views of the public on sex education and suggested the extent to which it could be discussed. With the instructors’ feedback, the students revised their teaching plans. In this process, the instructors only provided guidance and did not directly revise the students’ lesson plans."

          "The reflection activity ran throughout the course. Before the service activities, the instructors introduced relevant theories, and the students reflected on their personal growth with reference to the theories. In the workshops, the instructors guided the students to apply skills acquired in lessons on classroom management and in drawing the attention of class participants. The instructors presented specific situations and questions and helped the students to learn through case studies that were discussed to find solutions to problematic situations. The instructors observed that after continuous reflection activities, the students used what they had learned to analyse problems and reflect on their personal learning in the process of offering service.\n\nDuring the service activities in Hangzhou, the course instructors and the students from PolyU and Zhejiang University participated in reflection meetings at the end of the daily activities, and the primary school teachers sometimes participated. The students were more willing to share their feelings and self-reflections in a learning environment that enabled sincere expression, mutual trust and a safe and supportive atmosphere. All of the students talked about their teaching process in class and reflected on their own performance and difficulties in the service activities. They also shared how to get along with the children. In addition to the positive learning outcomes, all parties involved shared their weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n\nIn the reflection meetings, the Zhejiang University research students acted as observers and shared what they had seen in the teaching sessions. With reference to how the university students addressed the different physical and psychological needs of the schoolchildren, the course instructors designed a classroom observation sheet. Before taking up their role as observers, the students were required to attend a workshop on using the observation sheets, the principles of recording and giving positive encouragement and constructive opinions when making comments on the students’ performance. Although the results were not considered in the course assessment, the use of these observation sheets helped the students to structure their observation contents, follow proper observation principles and give helpful opinions and suggestions during the reflection meetings. The course instructors found that the comments were very helpful for improving the teaching process and thus allowed the students to make timely adjustments to the upcoming service sessions.\n\nTo overcome the challenges and difficulties raised by the students and the observers, the instructors provided timely feedback and suggestions on, for example, how to talk to and get along with the children. For problems that could not be resolved immediately, the students were provided with some guiding principles to identify the causes of problems onsite. The instructors followed up with individual students who were facing emotional issues and offered personal support. The PolyU students pointed out the differences in educational methods between mainland China and Hong Kong, as teachers in China placed greater emphasis on disciplining pupils in class and had stricter rules. Accordingly, the PolyU students expressed their views and discussed how to use interactive methods during the lessons."

              "Service learning differs from traditional teaching. It requires the instructor to accept the concept of service learning and to believe that it can have a positive impact on students’ learning. The instructor also must have a concrete and thorough understanding of the characteristics of service learning and invest more time and energy in matters related to other stakeholders, such as the students and other service partners. The instructor also needs to provide students with additional guidance on the design and implementation of teaching plans with the service partners and recipients. Therefore, the course instructors must invest time to thoroughly understand the service partners’ needs and expectations.\n\nIn the Children course, during the preparation stage before the service activities, the course instructors provided guidance and support to the students, including guidance on designing teaching plans. For example, the course instructors suggested adjusting the level of content difficulty when the primary school pupils found the content hard to understand. The instructors also gave advice on whether the selected topic was suitable for mainland Chinese pupils and suggestions on how the university students could revise the plan according to the background and context of the primary school. For example, a group of students designed topics related to sex education. The course instructors explained the differences between mainland China and Hong Kong in terms of physical health and sex education provided to primary school pupils and advised the university students how to adapt their teaching plans and methods. With reference to the instructor’s opinions, the students revised their teaching plans.\n\nIn another example, the Children course focused on promoting positive youth development. Understanding and respecting the diversity of schoolchildren is an important principle of this theme. In their instruction on designing teaching plans and during their students’ teaching practice, the course instructors paid much attention to guiding the students to consider the diversity of their pupils. If some pupils could not keep pace with the class, the instructors made specific suggestions on how to set up layered content and coursework. During implementation, the diversity of the schoolchildren was also taken into consideration, and different kinds of support and help were provided to the children in line with their individual participation in class activities.\n\nOnce the service activities formally began, the university students encountered some unforeseen challenges, and their emotions fluctuated. The course instructors took great care to provide emotional support to the students. They observed the students’ performance and improvement in their attitudes, engagement levels and care for the pupils. The instructors recognised the students’ strengths and proposed suggestions for improvement. The instructors observed that when university students were positively encouraged, they were often more willing to take the initiative to better their teaching plans and consider multiple strategies to improve the learning effectiveness of primary schoolchildren. For example, everyone was frustrated on the first day of teaching. The instructor focused on giving emotional support to the university students by telling them that their performance on the first day was not the most important. The instructors were more concerned with the time and energy that the university students had devoted to all aspects of service, their attitude towards service activities, their care of the primary school pupils and their own improvement throughout the process. The instructors recognised the strengths of the university students and pointed out areas for improvement. This encouraged the students to take the initiative to change themselves, revise their plans and consider using various strategies to get along with the primary school pupils.\n\nIn addition, good performance in running service activities depended strongly on a good collaborative relationship between the university and the community. The university students’ performance in service activities became a crucial factor in this relationship, and therefore, the instructors paid increasing attention to their performance. As the course was compulsory for all undergraduate students, the participating students had diverse backgrounds and learning motives. For example, some university students were less willing to participate at the beginning of the course and simply wanted to meet the basic course requirements. Experience has shown, however, that when university students come into direct contact with primary school pupils, they often change their views on service activities. Therefore, the course instructors provided timely and relevant guidance to help the students understand the meaning and functions of their service activities."

In addition, on the last day of the service activity, the primary school pupils wrote letters to the university students in which they wrote what they most wanted to say. The course instructors also invited the school principal and the head teachers of each class to fill out a questionnaire evaluating the performance of the PolyU students.\n\nIn addition to the questionnaire, the course instructors reviewed the effectiveness of the entire service activity with the principal and all of the head teachers after each service event. According to the opinions of the principal and the teachers, the instructors made adjustments to the teaching arrangements for the next year. For example, in the first year, one head teacher noted health issues that could pose a safety hazard. Therefore, in the workshops held during the next year, the instructors emphasised the role of sanitation in class management, demonstrating to the university students how to arrange a daily student-on-duty and how to check doors and windows. The primary school teachers felt very satisfied with these adjustments.\n\nThe course instructors also received feedback from other research projects. For example, another research team at PolyU also visited the school in Hangzhou. Colleagues from the research team shared their results with the course instructors, noting that some students mentioned that the five-day service activities were only ever carried out in the school. The service activities had become somewhat boring for the university students, who lacked both an understanding of the local culture and the opportunity for cultural exchanges with Hangzhou residents. The course instructors took this into account and made adjustments to the service arrangement for the next year, designating four days for teaching and one day as a cultural day. In the morning of the cultural day, the university students led the primary school pupils to visit a museum near the school; in the afternoon, they discussed several topics, such as the impressive items that they saw in the museum exhibition. The schoolchildren introduced objects that represented Hangzhou’s culture, while both the PolyU and Zhejiang University students described the cultures of their hometowns. The primary school pupils each brought an object from home and explained it using their personal stories. This sharing activity allowed the PolyU students to gain a richer understanding of the schoolchildren and the local culture within a short period of time."

If the course instructors can help some of these students to prepare properly and give appropriate guidance during the process of learning and service, the students can learn and make a change in their attitude to service. However, some students are especially resistant to change. These students regard service learning as a forced activity and invest the least possible amount of time and effort, which makes it difficult for instructors to communicate in depth with these students.\n\nThe two-semester course schedule also has certain limitations. As some of the theories are taught in the spring semester, the students may have forgotten some of the content by the beginning of the summer workshop. Therefore, some students have suggested that all content be taught at the beginning of the summer semester."

            text: "Dr Law has taught the Art course since the 2008–2009 academic year. Initially, she strongly believed that experiential learning was crucial for students, because the objective of the course was to explore the influence of art on individuals or a group. She believed that if her students could create art that would change the lives of others or even affect a whole community, then the experience would facilitate a deeper understanding of relevant theories. However, during her first year of teaching the Art course, Dr Law was unfamiliar with the concept and practice of service learning, which organisations were available for collaborative learning and how such collaborations should operate. Therefore, she continued to apply classroom teaching methods in the course but also began to communicate with her colleagues from the Office of Service-Learning (OSL) at Lingnan University and learned about strategies for collaborating with other institutions and service-learning teaching practices.\n\nIn the 2009–2010 academic year, Dr Law attempted to incorporate the elements of service learning into her Art course. During this period, 20 students took the course, eight of whom participated in service-learning activities. These students were divided into two teams of four students each and provided services to each of the two groups, they are adults with mental disability and children of South Asian ethnicity. Only eight students were chosen to participate in the service-learning activities during this academic year because Dr Law wished to closely follow their progress and to ensure the quality of the services provided. As the students who participated in service learning were not required to join the course’s tutorial classes, Dr Law made some adjustments to the contents of the Art course. For example, she taught some key concepts and theories in lectures, rather than in tutorials, so that all of the students could learn the relevant knowledge. Since the 2009–2010 academic year, the number of students participating in service-learning activities each year has ranged from four to 10. In one academic year, Dr Law attempted to require all 20 students in the Art course to participate in service-learning activities by offering no other choices for activities. However, she was very concerned that such a requirement would affect students’ willingness to participate in service learning and their commitment.\n\nDuring the first academic year in which the Art course included service learning (2009–2010), the students reported positive learning outcomes. These positive results led Dr Law to recognise the value of service learning, which emphasises a mutual exchange of benefits and can serve as a platform for inter-professional sharing. More importantly, Dr Law has found that participation in service learning can help students to have changes. The students’ experiences and reflections demonstrated that they had come to understand the power of art as a good means of expression and communication. Some students reported that their social awareness and sense of civic responsibility had increased during the process of helping a specific community group. These students were not only concerned about their own affairs but also cared more about society and the community in general. Other students reported that their attitudes towards family members and ways of relating to them had changed. The students further reported that the experience had reduced the stereotypes they held about minority groups in society. For example, some students stated that after the course, they paid more attention to members of the South Asian community around them; the students expressed a willingness to learn and respect the community’s customs.\n\nAfter several years, Dr Law began to realise the long-term impact of the Art course on students’ career development. Around 10% of the students who had taken the course worked or planned to work for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) after graduating from the university. Some of them worked as professional art clinicians. One student worked as a programme manager to enhance the quality of life of elderly residents in a nursing home, which he described an ‘art home’. Other students shared that they had been inspired by their experiences with service learning and would like to apply these experiences in the future. "

            header: "The course brief",
            text: "Regarding the course outline, the Art course\n\n\tis designed to provide students with an introduction to the healing power of art. The concept of communicating personal ideas through art and of achieving a sense of well-being through artistic creation is not new, but the study and practice of using art and art-making as a form of healing have emerged only recently. Cross referencing findings of advanced modern sciences, theories of art and anthropology, the course investigates how artistic creation and general engagement with art can help people to gain an awareness of themselves and others, as well as to cope with symptoms, stress, and traumatic experiences. A Service Learning Research Scheme is incorporated if relevant services are available. \n\nDr Law’s classroom lectures have covered topics such as the biological nature of art making; art, sciences and the visual; art and memory; art and well-being; history of using art as therapy; art and psychoanalysis; art and education; art and symbols; art therapy; and art facilitation.\n\nDr Law also believes that university students benefit from workshops or sharing sessions with alumni before participating in service activities. Such sessions enable the students to better understand service learning and prepare them to learn through participation in service-based activities. These sessions are intended to achieve the following:\n\n\t • Communication of the idea that service learning is not only about giving to others but also about gaining knowledge and enjoying the process;\n\t • Elimination of students’ common misunderstandings about service learning, such as the perception that service learning is equivalent to volunteering or that students should feel a sense of superiority during the service process;\n\t • Encouragement for students participating in service activities non-voluntarily to help them recognise the unique learning experiences provided by service learning; and \n\t • Assistance with students’ future planning for activities based on their expertise.\n\nThe above pre-service training also helps students with their psychological preparation for service activities and with understanding the importance of serving with love and devotion. In addition to the preparatory worshops and sessions arranged by Dr Law and the art facilitator, the OSL at Lingnan University provides lectures and consultation services to help students understand the meaning of service learning.\n\nWhile designing and preparing the service activities for the Art course, Dr Law readied the students to prepare alternative strategies for dealing with unexpected situations. For instance, the students who provided services to children in the South Asian community intended to organise the first workshop for 10-year-old children; however, three kindergarten-aged children also attended the workshop. Additionally, the number of participants may vary and might be unpredictable. For instance, one workshop might draw 20 participants, whereas the next workshop may only have three participants. After the first workshop, the university students realised that they could prepare two plans and choose the plan appropriate for the actual situation. For example, if both older and younger children attended the workshop, the university students could put a large piece of paper on the table and ask the children to stand around it. The university students would then tell the children that each participant had to create a painting related to a ‘jungle’ theme according to their own capabilities. This allowed the children to paint anything without correction from the university students, who came to understand that some of the children liked whales, while others liked McDonald’s."

      partnership: {
        content: "As she learned more about potential collaborating organisations through the OSL at Lingnan University, Dr Law began to work with two organisations with the assistance of her colleagues from the office. Since then, she has communicated with these collaborating partner organisations before planning service-learning activities for the Art course. She also has met with her colleagues from the OSL to explore possible collaborations with additional suitable organisations. \n\nDr Law has invited art facilitators to join her on visits to the collaborative organisations. She has employed the art facilitators to facilitate the students’ learning and provide guidance and support to the students during service-learning activities. During Dr Law’s meetings with the partner organisations, both parties have shared their expectations, the types of service activities that could be provided by the university students and the characteristics of the service recipients. For instance, during a meeting at a centre in Tung Chung that provides services to immigrants, the centre’s staff relayed the challenges of integration into Hong Kong society faced by new immigrants, due to the immigrants’ narrow social ties and experiences of discrimination from Hong Kongers. The centre expected university students to assist the immigrants with this social issue. Accordingly, the students more strongly emphasised the use of a variety of art forms to enable new immigrants to express their emotions and life situations.\n\nAfter running similar service activities for a period of time, Dr Law considered how these collaborating relationships might be sustained and deepened. However, communications with the partner organisations involved some uncertainties due to, for instance, potential turnover in the leadership of an organisation. Furthermore, the objectives of the two collaborating parties might diverge over the course of a long-term (e.g., 3-year) collaborative project. Accordingly, discussions with partner organisations would have to address not only the number of workshops that the students would be expected to provide for the service recipients but also how the organisations might change substantially in the long run. Such discussions would require further and more thorough communications with collaborating partner organisations.\n\nAs the Art course has been run for several years, the OSL has a better understanding of the characteristics of the course’s curriculum and its service requirements. Accordingly, when the OSL encounters suitable organisations and service needs, the staff actively contact Dr Law to further develop and diversify the provided service activities. For example, a colleague from the OSL introduced the Art course and its service activities to an organisation that provides services to teenagers. The university students who completed service activities with this organisation were very impressed by the experience. They found it impactful to meet younger teenagers with difficult lives. The experience enhanced the university students’ empathy and gratitude for their families and the school resources available to them."

        content: "During the 2019–2020 academic year, Dr Law collaborated with the first two partner organisations, which provided services for people with disability and youth in the South Asian community. When choosing the service recipients, she mainly considered the extent to which the characteristics of the recipients matched with the content of the course, with the intent that students who had completed the service-learning process would realise that they had applied the theories and knowledge learned in the classroom to real-life settings. Such experience would enable the students to fully understand the theoretical knowledge gained in the course.   \n\nDr Law explained that she had chosen people with mental disability as service recipients because little was known about how to communicate with these individuals in daily life. One learning point of the Art course is the use of art as a platform for promoting communication and expression and, ultimately, facilitating connection. She had selected children of South Asian ethnicity as service recipients because their English and Cantonese language skills were not strong enough to enable them to study and participate fully in daily life in Hong Kong. Using art as a second and universal language is another learning point of the Art course. Dr Law believes that art and art-related disciplines are highly suitable platforms for combining certain service activities. The service recipients experience delight while participating in art-related activities, and play is a form of learning. During the process of play, children and university students can establish close, loving relationships and connect with each other."
      },
      service: {
        content: "Dr Law expected that by participating in service activities through the course, the students would learn to appreciate the power of art and be thankful. Art is a platform used by people to facilitate self-expression, communication and connection with others. Most of the service activities arranged by Dr Law involved people with disability, members of the South Asian community and new immigrants as service recipients, with the expectation that direct connections with these populations would allow students to realise the power of art. For example, it is relatively difficult to communicate with people who have dementia, autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities, but face-to-face interactions can change students’ general perceptions of people with these conditions. \n\nOne student who did not initially engage in all aspects of the course later reported a fruitful learning outcome after participating in unique service activities. This student joined a group that provided service to a group of people with severe disability in a residential facility. The people in this group had been wheelchair-bound for a long time, and many of them were unable to use language to express themselves. Accordingly, a piece of paper containing the words ‘water’, ‘rice’, ‘toilet’, ‘clothes’, ‘cold’ or ‘hot’ was placed in front of each of their chairs, and they would point to the correct word to communicate their intent. When the university students met the service recipients and realised the degree of their intellectual disability, they realised that the originally planned group activities could not be carried out and would need to be converted to one-to-one activities. During this process, the university students were touched by their experiences with caring for people with intellectual disability in their own age group. They found it difficult to imagine that some of their peers had been restricted to beds and wheelchairs since birth. During the service activities, a girl with a mental disability forged a connection with one of the university students and cried when her artistic activities with the student were completed. This emotional connection had also moved the university student, who began to cherish what he had in his life. He began to treat his life and studies more seriously and considered studying psychology.\n\nAll of the students were moved by their connections with the service recipients. For example, the recipients expressed reluctance when the university students left. Some of them asked, ‘You are not coming back? Please come back!’ These simple and sincere expressions were very touching to the university students. Some students stated that if they had time in the future, they would continue to serve as volunteers. Such service experiences enable university students to eliminate the stereotypes that they hold about people with intellectual disabilities and increase their willingness to interact actively with members of this population. Through such interactions, university students can see the positive characteristics of people with intellectual disabilities. Although the members of this population have a limited IQ, they tend to be kind and do not deceive people. They also prefer to express emotions directly, such as whether they are happy or not. Such things cannot be taught in a classroom. For this reason, Dr Law has insisted on integrating service learning into her course.\n\nOne student who worked with children in the South Asian community mentioned that during the ice-breaking phase, the university students played ‘passing the music box’ with the children. In this game, the rule was that whoever held the music box had to tell where he or she was from. When the music box was passed to a university student, he said, ‘I am from Dongguan’. A Pakistani teenager then asked, ‘Were you not born in Hong Kong?’ This teenager had realised that the university students were not all originally from Hong Kong. The idea that ‘we are not local Hong Kongers’ resonated with these Pakistani teenagers, and they began to share which provinces in Pakistan they had come from. The university students realised that they could help people in the South Asian community to integrate into Hong Kong society by building relationships. They also realised that the South Asian population was not a marginal ethnic minority group.\n\n\tI saw a lot of transformation, so this is why I am devoted to service-learning.  I think these are things that students cannot get in the classroom. If they do not experience by themselves, they could not have deep understanding.\n\nDuring the Art course, the students designed and implemented art activities as a group. This arrangement allowed them to learn how to cooperate with each other and flexibly handle unexpected situations while in service. The service recipients and the activities themselves also provided opportunities for university students to tackle specific tasks. For example, while implementing workshops for children in the South Asian population, some of the participating children exhibited overactivity or sudden aggressive behaviour or paced back and forth. The university students quickly learned that some team members needed to communicate and work with these children in a one-to-one setting. This experience demonstrated to the university students the importance of cooperation while implementing workshop activities. Although each person takes a different role when implementing an activity, these roles must be reassigned whenever an unexpected situation (e.g., accident) occurs. Through such experiences, the university students can learn the importance and pleasure of cooperation, and some may even become good friends over time."

      reflection: {
        content: "Students in the Art course who participated in the service-learning component were required to complete six to eight service activities, each lasting for 1 to 2 hours. After completing two or three service activities, the students were asked to return to the university to participate in a group consultation session, where they shared the current status of the service activities and any problems. In these consultations, Dr Law focused on guiding the students to think and connect their service experiences with their knowledge on the subject. She emphasised the importance of arranging a consultation section at this point in the service-learning component. Some students initially believed that ‘service’ meant ‘volunteer work’. Although they had planned and developed activities and were guided by an artist, many students became very confused once in the field; they did not know what they wanted to achieve, or their plan was not feasible and they did not know how to handle the situation and move forward.\n\nAfter starting the service activity, the students were required to record what they had observed and their experiences. For example, if a student observed that a child exhibited very rude behaviour, they were asked to explain the rude behaviour and language performance (e.g., kicking others, swearing or crying after kicking someone). The students were required to carefully observe the service process and to make an on-the-spot record and reflection within 15 minutes after the end of the daily activity. The students were expected to bring these recorded contents to the consultation sessions with Dr Law. \n\nThe consultations with Dr. Law were intended to help students understand the meaning of service learning. After talking with the teachers, most of the students began to understand what they were doing and should do. For instance, some students attempted to make art with service recipients who did not respond or rarely participated, and the students did not know how to handle the situation. Dr Law began by asking the students to think about what they really wanted to do and guided them to think about the differences between art and language. As art is a visual and sensory – rather than structural – form of language, Dr Law further guided the students to understand how specific service activities could reflect the role of art as a visual language through which to express senses and feelings. This perspective enabled students to focus on sensory experiences during the service activities. For example, they recorded a variety of sounds, such as birdsong and fireworks. After listening to these sounds, the service recipients from the South Asian community or population with disability were asked to draw what they had heard. During such a process, the course instructor Dr. Law plays a very important role in the consulting activities because they are most familiar with the subject knowledge. Accordingly, instructors are required to invest in a lot of time and energy in this role. In another example from the course, one group of university students designed eight creative workshops for South Asian students in Sham Shui Po. At the first consultation, one of the students mentioned that he had not known that there were very poor areas in Hong Kong.\n\nThe university students encountered many challenges when participating in service activities. In one situation, a 10-year-old girl wanted to bring her 3-year-old brother to participate in an activity designed for 10-year-olds. Accordingly, the students faced the challenge of arranging an activity that would be suitable for both a 10-year-old and a 3-year-old. Additionally, the classroom provided by the collaborating NGO was very small, and the participating children were very excited. As part of the room was being renovated, the art facilitator became very concerned about the children’s safety. The problem of the small space could not be solved, and the children became increasingly active. Therefore, changing the contents of the workshop was not a feasible solution. Finally, the artist decided to cancel the remaining four workshops after the end of the fourth course. The university students who were participating in the service activities were very frustrated with this outcome and thought that their efforts had been wasted. Dr Law tried to guide the students to learn from failure. Accordingly, she led them to focus on what had been learned in the process of designing and implementing four workshops.\n\nIn another example drawn from the provision of service activities for children in the South Asian community, the collaborating NGO proposed during planning to reserve a half-hour during each workshop, during which the NGO would arrange specific activities. While participating in the service activities, the university students learned that this half-hour was reserved for the children to complete the task of copying Chinese characters. This activity conflicted with the principles of spontaneity, joy and self-direction that the university students had developed. The South Asian children were not very interested in writing and even drew randomly. Dr Law advised the students to communicate directly with social workers at the NGO to try to understand the purpose and objectives of the task. She also asked the university students to consider whether they were willing to teach the Chinese language to the South Asian children. She then gave specific suggestions, such as starting with the characteristics of the Chinese characters, such as the hieroglyphs and phonographic structures, to help the South Asian children understand Chinese characters more rapidly. Accordingly, she explained that if the university students presented a cooperative attitude when communicating with the social workers, they might double the expected results of the workshop. After discussion, the social workers agreed that the university students could teach during the following activity session, during which the students happily played with hieroglyphics for a half-hour.\n\nDr Law believes that guidance must be flexible; the students must be led to realise that the key to providing service is to understand the needs of the service recipients, rather than what the students think that they can give to or do for the recipients. Therefore, students should learn to listen to the needs and requirements of the service recipients and use the service activities to meet certain aspects of these needs."

            text: "Students who participated in service learning during the first year of the Art course were required to complete many assessment tasks and complained that the process was laborious. Specifically, the students were required to complete the following: \n\t • One group oral presentation (students in other years needed to complete 2 presentations);\n\t • One reflection essay (not required of students in other years); and\n\t • Final papers and an examination (also required of students in other years). \n\nIn response to the complaints from the students in the service-learning group regarding the large amount of work, Dr Law revised the requirements for assessment in the following year.  Students in the service-learning group were allowed to combine their final papers with their reflection essay. Although the reflective essay had only required students to describe the status of the service activities and their personal reflections, the final paper was an academic manuscript, and thus the students were required to include references to academic literature and analysis and discussion of relevant theories on the subject.\n\nIn this three-credit course, the students were required to not only complete the service activities but also to link theoretical knowledge with these activities to validate the theories and gain a deeper understanding of the social issues embedded within the service activities. The students accepted this requirement because it afforded them the opportunity to draw on the theories learned in the classroom when explaining the problems and phenomena encountered during service activities. Dr Law observed that individual students who attempted to challenge the academic literature that they read also performed better during service activities. These students found it relatively easy to transform their specific experiences into words."

            text: "The art facilitators mainly have provided advice relating to the status of the services during consultations and presentations, as well as feedback on students’ performances. As the art facilitators complete the service activities along with the students, the facilitators’ observations and evaluations are a crucial part of the course. The art facilitators record their observations of and evaluation scores for each student participating in the service activities, which serve as references for Dr Law’s assessments. The art facilitators do not simply assign scores based on the evaluations but also are asked to provide examples to justify their suggested scores.\n\nDr Law has invited colleagues from the collaborating organisations to attend the students’ presentations and give advice on the students’ performance and the issues discussed in their reports. She has also asked for written records and evaluations from the organisations, time permitting. The whole process has promoted a mutual understanding between the collaborating organisations and the students. In a previous example, the social workers were concerned about safety issues because the university students had designed too many activities for children with hyperactivity, whereas the students believed that it would be difficult to stimulate a child’s inner self while in a quiet state. In their group presentation, the university students had the opportunity to explain the rationale for their chosen activities, and the social workers were able to express and explain their concerns. As a result, the group presentation shifted from an assessment and sharing session to an opportunity for dialogue between different parties.\n\nFrom her perspective as a teacher, Dr Law believes that providing feedback to students should be a flexible process. For instance, when listening to students’ demands and attempting to understand their frustrations, teachers should judge whether each student’s observations are appropriate according to their situation and whether their complaints are reasonable, understand the emotions that students experience during service and help them to resolve their negative emotions. Therefore, listening is equally important for students and teachers. Although teachers can prepare questions and talking points in advance, they should provide specific suggestions according to each student’s specific challenges during consultations and when giving feedback. Dr Law always asks her students three questions: ‘What is the goal of this workshop?’, ‘What are you doing now?’ and ‘What is your biggest problem?’ "

            text: "In the Art course, each student team is assigned a professional art therapist or art facilitator to provide guidance and assistance. The facilitator gives advice on the service proposals prepared by students. Before commencing the service activities, the facilitator visits the  partner organisation to learn about the service recipients’ specific characteristics and to propose requirements for the university students’ training and preparation. For instance, in a service activity involving service recipients with intellectual disabilities who had symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder, it was expected that helping the university students to understand why the recipients exhibited these behavioural symptoms, and how to handle them, would alleviate the students’ tension and fear due to a lack of understanding. In this regard, the facilitator’s role is to motivate and inspire university students rather than to supersede them in implementing proposals or finishing art workshops.\n\nThe art facilitator also assists Dr Law in communications with the partner organisation to understand its needs and the characteristics of the service recipients. The art facilitator then determines when and how the students should provide support and how to help the students understand the course and the expectations and requirements of service. For example, university students might not be aware that their inadvertent speech might be considered discriminatory against certain populations. In this scenario, the art facilitator would help to improve the students’ cross-cultural sensitivity and explain how to avoid harming others during communications. Reminders given by the facilitator before the activities can also help to fully prepare the students to enter the service settings."

            text: "During their service periods, university students have often encountered situations that they have not known how to handle. In such cases, Dr Law has provided timely guidance. For instance, a student was talking with an elderly woman who mentioned that all of her relatives had passed away and she was alone. The woman began to cry, and the students did not know how to handle the immediate situation. After the service activity, the students immediately contacted Dr Law, who used the following approach:\n\n\t • First, she attempted to understand how the students handled the situation.\n\t • Next, she led the students to think and reflect on the situation (e.g., why would the elderly woman have burst into tears suddenly, and during interactions with whom would (or would not) she cry, and why). Given her belief that art is about emotions, Dr Law considered that aspects of the activities might have triggered the woman’s deep emotions. Dr Law provided guidance on handling such a situation.\n\t • Dr Law then guided the students to identify solutions. She asked the students to let the elderly woman describe her feelings and experiences and then choose colours that would represent her feelings and help her to release her negative emotions. Once the woman had calmed down, she could be encouraged to draw a picture to express her current situation.\n\t • After communicating with the students, Dr Law called the social worker and informed him about the incident. She advised him to pay more attention to the emotions of the elderly people who participated in the activity.\n\nDr Law also coordinated and facilitated communications between the university students and the art facilitator. For instance, in an activity targeting children in the South Asian community, the art facilitator had very high expectations of the student team and asked the university students to modify their service proposals four times. Although the university students made revisions accordingly, they did not understand the reasons for the repeated revision requests and thought that the facilitator was too critical. When Dr Law was made aware of the situation, she found that the facilitator was asking the university students to pay more attention to fine details in the service proposals, such as the size of the scissors and the type of the adhesive tape. She then explained to the students the reasons for considering the use of specific materials, the importance of developing the habit of being precise and ways to understand and handle different types of work and requirements. Once the university students realised the facilitator’s positive intentions and his meticulous way of working with and caring for students, they began to appreciate his character and serious attitude and gradually became friends with him. Such interactions provide a good learning experience for students but cannot be taught in a classroom."

Since then, many organisations with sufficient financial resources have provided some financial support to the hired artist after learning about Dr Law’s courses and the service-learning activities. Additionally, Dr Law has established stable relationships with the collaborating artists who, in turn, reduce their fees because they have a deep appreciation of the importance of the service activities. For instance, an artist whose life had taken many twists and turns began to work with Dr Law to provide services to patients at Castle Peak Hospital and was led to correct his own mistakes through art. This artist only charged half of his regular fee as an art therapist when helping a young person with a criminal history. Dr Law is very grateful that she has met many people who are willing to devote their time to help others change their lives.\n\nThe OSL also provides some materials fees to the students; however, these fees are insufficient.

She also noticed that some students joined her course only to fulfil graduation requirements. When encountering these students, she first attempted to understand their difficulties. For instance, some students did not like painting, while others did not know how to communicate with the service recipients. Additionally, the students did not know how to arrange 2-hour activities at a service site. Dr Law emphasised that the focus of the service activities was not to teach new immigrants how to paint but rather to help them express their feelings and life challenges through art. She advised other students to arrange activities that were easy to handle, such as manual work and hand beading.\n\nHowever, Dr Law believed that the students’ interest in participating in the service activities presented the greatest challenge. In this regard, she explained to students the importance of the service activities and asked students to communicate with the service recipients (new immigrants) to better understand them. She also encouraged the students to become familiar with the new immigrants’ concepts expressed through art. For instance, many new immigrants, particularly women and teenagers, linked their hometowns with artistic expression and came to realise that their hearts were connected with their hometowns. Some students were very touched by this.\n\nNevertheless, Dr Law continues to face challenges related to students’ motivation to learn."

This course is offered by Professor Cheung Siu Yin of Hong Kong Baptist University.\n\nProfessor Cheung had been teaching service learning for more than 10 years. The idea of teaching service learning came after attending a service-learning workshop organised by a business school, where Professor Cheung began to understand the concept of service learning and how to provide new learning opportunities for students. Having been involved in many service and volunteer activities since childhood, she had a deep understanding of how service learning can help people to grow and change their perspectives.\n\nInitially, the students who took the Motor course were in their third or fourth year of university, and there were around 30 students in each class. The course was run in the spring (second) semester of each academic year. For approximately the first 6 years, Professor Cheung worked mainly with a kindergarten in Tai Po and a nearby centre for elderly people. This gave the students an opportunity to compare the muscular development of children and elderly people. Later, the curriculum was changed. The students who took the course were mainly first and second year students , and enrolment gradually increased to around 60 students. The course was also moved to the autumn (first) semester. As the timetable no longer matched that of the kindergarten, only the service activities at the centre for elderly people were retained. The students’ reflections and homework therefore focus on the physical fitness of elderly people."

            text: "Professor Cheung believed that building trust was crucial for a stable and long-term cooperative relationship. To ensure a win-win situation, regular discussions between the hosting university and the service-receiving institutions were important to benefit both the recipients and the students. After many years of cooperation with the centre for elderly people, the overall feedback had been very good. The elderly people all called Professor Cheung ‘Miss Cheung’, and she was pleased with their relationship.\n\nIn developing cooperative relations, equal status was maintained between the university students and elderly people to the benefit of both parties. The students from the Physical Education Department enthusiastically taught motor skills to the elderly people and guided them to exercise their limbs. Towards the end of the service, the elderly people often taught the university students any skills that they possess. For example, a 90-year-old once taught the students tai chi. The students also showed appreciation for the elderly people beyond merely being of service to them.\n\nAs Professor Cheung was very familiar with the centre for elderly people, it was easy to communicate when problems were encountered. For example, when the student numbers in the course increased from 30 to 60, she actively discussed adjustments to the arrangements and the organisation also shared their difficulties. Both parties took a positive approach to problem solving. Similar communications were maintained with the kindergartens, where the activities took place on a larger scale and served hundreds of children. Before an event, the principal was invited to the Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) to watch videos of previous events with the current university students and familiarise them with the preparations for the current event. After establishing an activity plan, one or two kindergarten staff members discussed the preparations and implementation of the sports meeting with the university students. Face-to-face meetings and negotiations helped both parties to understand each other’s needs and solve problems timeously. Professor Cheung found that direct communication with the kindergarten teachers was important to keep them informed of the students’ plans and allow the teachers to give timely feedback."

        content: "Professor Cheung was in total agreement that theory and service activities should be closely connected. It was important that students are able to apply the theory to their service activities. The Motor course focused mainly on how human muscles develop throughout life.\n\nIn addition to the subject content, Professor Cheung strived to help students develop their generic skills through a variety of activities. HKBU values teamwork ability, and group collaborations and oral presentations were used to promote students’ skills development and growth through meeting challenges. For example, the students were required to complete an oral report within 5 minutes, which served as a stress-coping exercise. In addition, when team members experienced disputes or conflict, Professor Cheung met with the whole team to discuss how to get along and cooperate with others, and how to adapt, assign roles and apply specific strategies during group work. As a facilitator, Professor Cheung focused on helping students learn how to handle situations."

        content: "During the first 6 years of the Motor course, the service activities developed for the kindergarten consisted of two main parts. First, the activities involved directly teaching the kindergarten children to develop fundamental motor skills. Through drawing lots for specific sports activities, the second part was divided into locomotor skills (e.g. running around) and manipulation skills (e.g. controlling an object). The students were divided into two groups to design activities, which were finally integrated to form a game and become part of the kindergarten’s sports meeting, involving the participation of 400 to 600 children and parents. For instance, if the results of drawing lots were running and throwing balls, these two activities would be jointly integrated into a game.\n\nIn addition, the university students were required to provide services for the centre for elderly people next door. This provided an opportunity for contact with both children and elderly people, enabling a comparison of how groups differed in terms of muscle development and movement."

      reflection: {
        content: "Professor Cheung placed great importance on reflection activities, emphasising systematic reflection and student-specific guidance and assistance in linking the service experience with the expected benefits to the subjects.\n\nDuring the reflection activities, Professor Cheung focused on guiding students to think about the attributes the HKBU expects of graduates, such as teamwork abilities, communication skills, cooperation skills and creativity.\n\nTo stimulate the students’ thinking, Professor Cheung asked them to observe the movements of both the children and their parents during the service activities and recorded this on a table listing the standards for each action, such as running skills and focusing skills. The students had to record whether children had reached the standards for each movement. Therefore, during the sports meeting, the university students not only helped to facilitate the recording but also had an opportunity to apply the content learned in class and observe the differences between children of various ages and their parents. This reflection record enabled the students to understand the muscular status of people of various ages."

For example, when designing activities for elderly people, each group of students was required to organise at least two meetings. If any students were absent, points were deducted from their scores. Each group of students was required to submit a service activity proposal for the games and the lesson plans they had designed. The event design must be completed within 6 weeks. Having clear instructions and requirements made it easy to engage the students, and Professor Cheung also observed that this resulted in better learning performance.\n\nThe students were also expected to provide sufficient references to the academic literature in the proposals they submit. For example, students were required to find four to six relevant articles related to physical fitness and motor development for adults. Studying the literature helped the students to design the service activities and understand the content, difficulties, materials, and safety concerns of various games."

Students had to record their attendance and describe their own contribution to the service activities. In particular, attendance on the day of the service activity was very important. If students were absent, 5 points were deducted from their scores. For group tasks, to promote engagement by all group members, Professor Cheung included a ‘best team member’ award. If 50% or more of the team members agreed that one student was the best team member, this student gained extra points. Similarly, team members lost points if they were rated the ‘worst team member’ by 50% or more of their team members. The purpose of peer evaluation was to enhance student engagement in the group activities, but the point deduction was not the only response to poor team participation. Professor Cheung also met separately with students who had been identified as the ‘worst team member’ to understand their circumstances. In this case, the score deduction was just 0.5 points, but it made the students aware of their shortcomings to help improve their behaviour. Furthermore, Professor Cheung also requested students to report both the group assignment and the proportion of their own contribution to each task. Students then needed to sign their names to acknowledge that everyone was satisfied with the division of labour. This approach helped to promote student responsibility and engagement.\n\nAfter completing the service activities, the students were required to finish their individual reports. The purpose of this assignment was to remind them to carefully review the physical and motor skills of elderly people during the service process. This review was related to the literature-reading assignment previously assigned to the students. For example, students selected to review the literature on the physical strength of elderly people would need to review the corresponding targeted service recipients during the activities."

Such standards ensured diversity within each group and enabled the group to cope better with different types of tasks, thereby promoting mutual cooperation."

The time each student spent interacting with the elderly had also decreased, as the pairing ratio had changed from 1:1 to 1:2. This had also affected the atmosphere during the service activities.\n\nThe university had provided small grants for service-learning courses, and senior students or graduates could be invited to provide advice and support on the service site or to complete in-depth interviews to help improve the course. However, the core work, such as communication and coordination with the organisation, must now be carried out by the teachers themselves, who also had to complete additional administrative work to apply for the mini grant."

        content: "Case 4 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled ‘Community Engagement through Service-Learning’ (hereinafter referred to as Community). This course was offered by Ms Chan, Wing-Yee, Constance, at Lingnan University (LU).\n\nMs Chan’s Community course had been running for more than four years. Unlike other service-learning courses, Community was centred on the concept and practice of service-learning with the aim to enhance students’ self-understanding and their understanding of community through various interactive teaching and learning activities. This course provided an introduction to and overview of service-learning theory and practice, welfare and service provider institutions, and the emergence of social enterprises as well as local and global socio-environmental issues. The students were given the opportunity to complete a hands-on service project that they designed with the guidance of the course instructors and/or community supervisor(s). Through this group project, the students learnt to understand a specific community, such as how to meet the community’s needs, and thought critically about the issues involved. The course also helped the students understand the importance of reflection and ways of reflecting effectively. With their instructors’ supervision, the students were expected to learn autonomously and collaborate with each other.\n\nDuring classroom learning, Ms Chan introduced different aspects of service-learning, such as its historical background, theory, assessment methods, research skills, and methods for assessing community needs. According to the specific service recipients and service activities in each semester, Ms Chan introduced and discussed related social issues in the classroom. For example, some organisations cared for elderly people with dementia. Accordingly, the related in-class discussions were tailored to explore ageing issues. For service projects related to grassroots society, social issues such as poverty, global citizenship, and even social entrepreneurship companies were explored. The students were given the opportunity to delve into these social issues and learn about how different organisations and groups addressed these issues.\n\nThe instructors took the students to visit different communities to understand the various needs of service recipients. The students were then asked to design specific service-learning projects/activities to meet these social needs. Unlike other service-learning courses, the Community course was more flexible in its selection of service organisations and development of the related learning activities. The instructor also had the opportunity to identify partner organisations to cooperate with in the service-learning course based on her personal background, expertise, and relationships with these organisations. Ms Chan’s social work background supported her focus on specific social issues, such as poverty. Ms Chan worked to extend the scope of LU’s existing service activities by searching for organisations to collaborate with during the Community course and also discussed the possible service activities during the course with the current partner organisations."

            text: "Before beginning the Community course, Ms Chan prepared two or three service activities, communicated with different organisations, and learnt about the recent needs of institutions and the community. Accordingly, Ms Chan determined the types of services that her students could provide. For example, partner organisations may focus on food collection or women’s empowerment activities. Thus, the instructor introduced women’s empowerment issues to the students and any interested students could form a group to visit the women’s centre to learn more about the organisation, serve community recipients, and their specific needs. In the process of collecting and analysing data, the students could develop their own goals and specific plans for the service activities."

During the preparation stage, it was important to establish a good relationship with an organisation. Through good communication, both parties became familiar with the expected service and learning requirements, which helped to promote collaboration in alignment with the course requirements and maintain good daily communication. Thus, both parties actively collaborated and more easily achieved mutual agreement for the service projects.\n\nIn contrast, when there is insufficient trust and understanding between universities and organisations, additional work is required to ensure the effectiveness of the service activities. As a result, too many resources may be invested, which affects subsequent cooperation. For instance, Ms Chan worked with a hospice centre serving patients with cancer. The hospice centre wanted university students to help its members write their life stories. However, the centre had high expectations for the story-writing project and it was uncertain whether the university students had the skills to write about the patients’ life stories satisfactorily. To address this issue, Ms Chan arranged for the involvement of a clinical psychologist to help the students interview the patients, edit the interviews, and obtain the patients’ approval of their life stories. Although the hospice centre was ultimately satisfied with the outcome of the story-writing project, the necessary resources and massive time investment halted any follow-up cooperative activities. If the two parties had had a better mutual understanding beforehand, the project could have been more successful, with both parties having a clear understanding of their inputs and expectations before beginning their cooperation."

In addition, the service should take place in the neighbourhood near the university to enhance its chances of success. The instructors should be aware of the community’s needs so that they could more conveniently guide their students’ service-learning activities. The results of the focus group interview conducted by LU also showed that when the instructors and students participated in the service activities together, the students reported richer learning and knowledge acquisition. They also had a better understanding of the concepts and theories taught by the instructors during their classes."

The students could then form their own groups and look for the appropriate organisations to explore the social issues in which they were interested. Ms. Chan observed that ‘The role of the instructor is to guide the students to focus on linking their subject knowledge to their projects.

      reflection: {
        content: "While planning and implementing the service activities during the Community course, Ms Chan offered her students many opportunities to help them with their reflections. She visited partner organisations with the students to introduce them to the related social issues and debriefed all participants before and after conducting the service activities. Ms Chan often facilitated student reflection through art activities. For example, in a reflection meeting, she gave pieces of paper and magazines to the students and then facilitated their reflections and writing using three questions. The students were asked to choose one colour to represent their feelings about participating in the service activity. They could choose from the magazines and materials provided to illustrate the observed community’s social issues in their own drawings, collages, or paintings and give suggestions for improving the service activities. The student groups shared and discussed their ideas based on their own artworks.\n\nAt the beginning of each class, the students reported their progress on the service-learning project. The instructor and other student groups then gave their feedback on the reports. From Ms Chan’s perspective, each group’s service activities were not individual activities but activities for the whole class. That is, each group’s sharing of their experiences allowed the other student groups to give suggestions and advice. When a student group needed help, the other student groups were asked to provide assistance. These interactions promoted an atmosphere of mutual support, which facilitated the common objective of service-learning. During this process, the students were given the opportunity to learn from each other and discovered that their actions could complement each other’s activities based on their own strengths and weaknesses. This learning process facilitated the students’ ability to seek help, cooperate with others, and solve problems. For example, when a student group completed a women-related service activity, they considered whether they could launch a ‘community kitchen’ service activity, by inviting the women involved to share their cooking skills with the university students. During the planning process for the cooking event, Ms Chan found that it was difficult to find a suitable venue for the large group. When the responsible students mentioned this need during class, everyone then discussed suitable venues and found a study room for students that could be used for the cooking event. Some students then went to look for the person in charge of the study room to discuss the feasibility of using the room for the cooking project. During this process, the whole class explored different resources to facilitate the completion of this activity."

The students also had to complete two group presentations to show the effectiveness of their planning proposal in terms of the results of their service-learning activities. During the implementation of the Community course, Ms Chan collected timely information from the partner organisations and passed on their feedback to her students. When she received feedback from partner organisations, she immediately informed her students, whether the feedback was positive or negative. This allowed the students to build their confidence because they knew that they were on the right track.

Therefore, some students attended the Community course because they needed to meet their graduation requirements. Ms Chan considered the interaction between the instructors and students as part of the learning process to broaden and enrich students’ horizons. These elements often became factors that changed the students’ motivation to learn and participate in service activities. Ms Chan often communicated with her students in the hope that they would change their perspectives on the service community’s problems. For instance, she asked her students why they did not like performing the service activities. If her students did not like performing these activities, Ms Chan encouraged them to consider this discomfort as a process of self-discovery.\n\nMs Chan chose to deal with her students’ attitudes and facilitated discussions of their motivations through group communication because she believed in the positive impact of group dynamics on individuals’ attitudes. When student groups participated in service activities, they saw that many of their peers were enthusiastically engaged in their respective activities. During this process, the students observed their peers and listened to each other’s stories about different service recipients. Many interpersonal interactive situations affected the students and they learnt more about themselves, society, and the service recipients. This process of continuous discovery and strengthening of their understanding had the power to change the students’ perspectives. At the final sharing session, many students often mentioned that they had discovered that instead of serving others, they were actually being served by others. The students had not considered that they could learn much from the women and elderly people they served during their learning-service activities. In addition, they had not thought that they might need to face similar issues in their twenties and had not considered the value of having a family. Throughout their learning-service activities, the students began to better understand the lives and suffering of other people. The neighbourhood communities taught these students the value of empathy, life experiences, and wisdom.\n\n‘When motivating students, we must consider each individual’s agenda. We must continue to encourage highly motivated students. For students with low motivation, instructors must identify why they lack motivation and encourage them to learn about themselves through performing service activities’."

These students were then trained in communication skills, project management, problem-solving, and self-understanding strategies.\n\nThe recruited students were very enthusiastic about the service-learning activities and used their experience to help new students in the Community course. The teaching assistants helped students liaise with partner organisations and handled course-related affairs and preparations. They could also take on some of the instructors’ duties to provide guidance to students during the current academic year. The teaching assistants had taken the course before and were familiar with the course structure and expectations; thus, they actively cooperated with the course instructors to improve the course. If a disconnect between the Community course and the service activities was identified, the teaching assistants could suggest alternative teaching units and themes.\n\nSome students did not report their experiences of difficulties to their instructor promptly. However, some found it easier to communicate with the teaching assistants because of their shared identity as students and let them know about any problems. For example, some team members might not be confident enough to talk to the instructor about some issues, but they were more willing to report problems to the teaching assistants, such as ‘free rider’ issues. Thus, the teaching assistants also served as a middle man to observe and solve the students’ problems in a timely manner."

When students conducted service activities in cooperation with these organisations, the organisations were then more willing to help them understand certain social issues. For example, one of the topics discussed during the course concerned poverty. The staff of the related partner organisation explained the poverty-related phenomena before and after each service activity. During the service process, staff guided the students’ perspectives and connected their experiences with what the students had understood from news media and the literature.\n\nCompared with the course instructors, staff from partner organisations were more familiar with the communities they served and could provide a better explanation of the social issues experienced by specific community groups that was easier for the students to understand. Poverty-related theories could be used to explain the specific situations and problems in Hong Kong. The students’ understanding of poverty was also reflected in the partner organisations’ feedback and the student groups’ reports.\n\nFor example, after the completion of service activities, the partner organisations’ social workers sometimes conducted a review and reflection session with the students. These social workers were well aware of the focus of the course and could act as co-educators to help the students identify and deepen their experiences during the service activities. The social workers were also more effective in identifying free riders among the students or poor performance. They directly expressed their expectations and unsatisfactory work areas to the students. These social workers also explained how the students could cope with the social needs of the community being served. The students who received direct feedback from partner organisations learnt to understand different perspectives and concerns, in addition to how their own performance was seen from other perspectives.

The participants were mainly students from the Department of Computing. They taught primary and secondary school students about the use of robots, VB programming statements, and certain Adobe software operations. Dr Ngai’s aim in developing the programme was to give the university students the opportunity to gain relevant experience and enhance their communication and presentation skills. She also hoped that the programme would aid those Hong Kong schools with relatively limited resources. Later, the scope of the service activities was extended to include schools in mainland China and Cambodia.\n\nThe outreach programme was gradually developed into a course. By 2010, it already had all of the necessary elements of a university course. The taught content included concepts and theoretical knowledge; the service activities required the students to apply what they had learned; assessments were done to evaluate students’ learning outcomes; and the activities followed set schedules. At the time, the range of the students’ effort and the expected learning outcomes even exceeded those of a three-credit course.\n\nFrom 2005, universities in Hong Kong had been reviewing and restructuring their courses as part of a shift towards a new academic system that would lengthen undergraduate study from three to four years long. This reform process was still ongoing at the beginning of 2012. Dr Ngai’s team used this opportunity to explore the possibility of developing the outreach programme into a credit-bearing course. The new Academic Vice-President recognised the effectiveness of the programme and supported it. Thus, in the academic year 2012–13, with the introduction of general education courses at the university, Technology was offered to all PolyU students as one such option."

It hoped that students would be able to work effectively in teams to solve problems and communicate effectively in the service delivery process. Finally, it expected students to reflect on how their service learning activities and experiences were related to the academic content of the subject, and to develop a sense of civic responsibility in using and deploying technological solutions.\n\nApart from attending discipline-specific lectures and seminars, and participating in project-specific seminars, students were also required to complete an e-learning model and take part in a service-learning project, which was designed to develop students’ creativity, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication abilities. Students were challenged to design and implement solutions, and apply their discipline-specific knowledge to meet community needs."

            text: "With reference to cooperating with organisations, Dr Ngai stated her belief that partners should not be changed frequently. The relationship established by the implementation of a service-learning course involves relationships between multiple stakeholders with various needs. University students seek good grades, teachers aim for students to learn while helping society, and cooperative organisations desire to help improve the community. In addition, different institutions vary in terms of their understanding and expectations of the collaboration; for example, an organisation that has previously worked with volunteers tends to treat students as volunteers rather than engaging them in mutually beneficial collaborative activities. Thus, establishing partnerships requires a process of mutual understanding, compromise, and consultation. It takes time to build trust between universities and partners but doing so opens the door to future activities and expanded opportunities for service and cooperation. Continuously interacting and repeatedly renewing the partnership can enhance the quality of cooperation and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. All of these require the universities and partners to develop mature relationships with each other.\n\nA continuous collaboration with the same organisation can also help the parties to anticipate the difficulties and challenges that students may encounter in the process; planning for these can then turn these potential challenges into learning opportunities whereby students grow from unexpected setbacks. For example, with prior planning, the instructor can prepare students in advance to strategically manage accidents that may threaten their safety or crises that they may find too difficult to handle."

In the process of continuous cooperation, the organisation members have the opportunity to observe the students’ and instructors’ attitudes and how they treat the service activities, and anticipate the changes that the students might bring to the community. The organisation and the community are frequently touched to see the high number of volunteers willing to help. It does take time for the organisation to see this willingness translate into a belief that, “We can really make some changes”, and eventually into a commitment that says, “We are working hard to make changes.” Encountering people with needs, the universities and organisations are willing to exert the time and effort to attain good practical results.

        content: "As Technology was moulded from a learning outreach programme into a credit-bearing course, its focus and subject content was modified accordingly. Initially, the course content was largely based on that of the original service outreach programme, which focused on the impact of computers on people and the world. Students were tasked with using the service activities to help the community solve specific problems using computers.\n\nWhen the course became credit-bearing, the profile of the students changed, and most of the enrolees were freshmen and sophomores from various majors of study. The course content was expanded to include an examination of the role of technology in human life, which is reflected in the requirement for users to master technology. For example, some elderly people who lack the knowledge of electronic decoding, cannot use e-banking services or other e-services such as logging into the government’s official website to register for a passport. In light of such realities, the course content and service activities of Technology were adapted, concentrating on how to use technology to help people in their daily lives. Specific service activities included the provision of e-learning education, teaching STEM, programming robots, installing software on computers, providing IT support, designing computer games for children with intellectual disabilities, and so forth.\n\nThe course was structured in a way that allocated one third of the students’ tasks to learning the theoretical framework in the classroom. One third of the students’ learning time comprised 40 hours of local service activities and a minimum 60 hours of overseas service activities. The remaining third of the course was for students to complete their own learning activities such as preparing for the service activities, developing small games in the laboratory, or engaging in reflection after the service activities. At the university, a three credit-bearing course requires students to spend about 120 hours on such independent learning tasks."

Students should conduct service activities that are practically helpful to society or to the service recipients, rather than merely providing them with emotional comfort. At the same time, students’ performance of these service tasks should not be mechanical. They should also benefit from the service activities and develop a deeper and broader understanding of society.\n\nThis was evident when university students who were sent to a poor region were assigned to participate in the specific task of “pulling the wire”. Beyond merely pulling the wire, it was emphasised that the students should also gain an understanding of the energy poverty of the region/country, and the impact of electricity on personal lives and on the development of the whole community. This kind of reflection was designed to help students see how they, as individuals, were integrated into society and recognise the situations confronting individuals not as separate phenomena but as interwoven into larger social issues. At the same time, these service activities also generated feelings of satisfaction among the students about their learning and service.\n\nIt was generally observed that the students demonstrated greater willingness to participate in tasks that had difficult but still achievable objectives. The success of their activities allowed them to see the real effects of their efforts, even when these were relatively simple; for example, a previously unelectrified village was given light. Witnessing how their efforts had helped the society/community allowed the students to recognise the value of what they had been learning. It also helped the students recognise the extent of what they could achieve. For a different task, Dr Ngai took students to a school that catered to pupils with special education needs. She assigned the students to design therapeutic games for them. She observed that the students were initially afraid of the pupils who had special needs or physical disabilities. However, after getting to know them, the students slowly overcame their fears. Their initial fear changed into a realisation that “it’s not so terrible”, and slowly into an attitude of, “we are helping them.” Along this process, the instructors noted that the students were beginning to recognise their own capacity to complete projects that could improve the community and help its people.\n\nComprehending social issues is not limited to knowing how the material conditions of a community can be improved; it also involves understanding the people and their living conditions. Dr Ngai expressed her hope that through their service experiences, the students could meet people living in communities where resources and technology were scarce, and observe how their lives were influenced by technology. When the students were designing their proposals and writing their reflections, Dr Ngai aimed to cultivate the students’ empathy by encouraging them to think about what they could contribute to these people and their communities. This required her to spend time considering several perspectives: engaging in discussions with the partner organisations about the feasibility of the students’ proposals and their possible effects, ensuring the feasibility of these projects, addressing the challenges faced by students in the process of acquiring the needed equipment/facilities, and allocating time for the students to reflect on and discuss how to complete the tasks. If the students were unable to complete the project, the partner would not be satisfied and the students would feel that they had not been supported."

The students would observe the instructors’ confidence in dealing with people in the community, their familiarity with the operations of the community and institutions, and their care for the students. All of these behaviours had the potential to be educational for the students, as the students reflected on the teachers’ example. For instance, Dr Ngai brought a group of university students to an institution where they took care of children with hyperactivity disorder. The moment they walked in, the children approached Dr Ngai to shake hands with her. Dr Ngai not only willingly held hands with the children; she also picked them up. When the students observed how Dr Ngai was interacting with the children, they imitated her by playing with the hyperactive children, treating them as normal people.\n\nThroughout the course of their site visits, the students were also led through daily post-event reviews. The reviews were conducted face-to-face at the service site. During this activity, the students reviewed the service tasks that they had completed, and considered how their service activities were connected to the learning that they had been taught in the classroom. This activity was not graded, to relieve the students of added pressure."

        content: "Following the University’s convention, students’ performance in this subject was assessed using a letter-grading system, with grades ranging from F (failure) to A+.\n\nFollowing the requirements set by PolyU, Dr Ngai followed the students’ progress and evaluated the efficacy of their learning through three phases of assessment: preparation, implementation and reflection. The score distribution for the three phases in terms of their relative weight to each other was roughly 3-4-3. The PolyU policy allows instructors in individual subjects to subdivide each of these components and give specific instructions pertaining to each requirement. For the Technology course, the relative weighting of the different assessment components was as follows. The grades for the class discussions, assignments, and plans/proposals for service composed 30% of the total grade. The students’ performance in rendering service was 40%. The grade for the reflective journal/report composed 30% of the final grade. The e-learning model was given a pass/fail mark.\n\nThe preparation stage of the Technology course included three requirements. First, students were assigned to work in groups to prepare an implementation plan. The evaluation of the plan focused on its feasibility, and this comprised 10% of the students’ overall grade. Second, students were required to write a personal reflection report about the preparation stage. This was a reflection on the impacts and advantages of technology and related concepts, allowing the students to systematically contemplate the relationship between technology and humans. This reflection report accounted for 15% of the students’ score. Third, the students’ participation and performance in class composed part of the score preparation score. The weight of this component varied each year, but was roughly 5%.\n\nAs mentioned above, the score of the implementation phase accounted for 40% of the overall grade. The assessment covered two items. The first item was the quality of the service activities, which accounted for 10–15% of the score. This was based on the small groups’ performance. The second item was an evaluation of the students’ attitudes, such as their commitment and contribution to the group activities. This was based on the instructor’s continuous on-site observations of the students.\n\nStudents’ reflections accounted for 30% of the total score, and they were required to complete two to three individual reflection journal entries or reflection reports for this component. Through the reflection reports, the instructor could assess whether the students understood the concepts that they had been taught, and could evaluate the depth or superficiality of their thoughts."

This course was offered by Dr. Theodore Lee, he is from the Education University of Hong Kong.\n\nRather than a course designed from the perspective of a certain subject knowledge, this course focused on making students understand individual social responsibility and most importantly, deepening their understanding through demonstration. By engaging students in working with different NGOs, Dr. Lee wanted students to understand how an organization viewed its mission and social responsibility, and how social workers and employees interpreted their work. If students had the chances to have direct contact with the service recipients, students could learn what these people really needed and why they needed it in a specific social context. These experiences enabled students to learn their social responsibilities. At the same time, their social responsibilities could be demonstrated concretely and students got to know how to use the resources they had to give back to the society.\n\nIn the course Working, students would go to different types of NGOs and participated in the work assigned by the organization. Through observation, interview, communication and direct involvement in daily work, students got to know how NGOs fulfilled their social missions.\n\nPrior to the service activities, students learnt theories and concepts about social responsibilities in the classroom. The instructor would also invite colleagues of the service agency to share how they completed their daily work, how they perceived the meaning of their work and the social issues, how they solved problems to improve the community. In addition, through the provision of assistance in different NGOs, students had the opportunity to learn some working attitudes and common skills, such as punctuality, communication, and coordination between different people and different jobs."

When students were paying attention to some social issues and were expecting the completion of some activities, the staff of NGOs needed to spend more time to help students complete their projects. When the students lacked the knowledge of the NGOs, and did not know their work priority, then the NGOs were serving the students, rather than the students serving the NGOs, which failed to yield mutual benefits.\n\nThe focus of Dr. Lee’s course was to understand the NGOs along with the staff working in NGOs. Therefore, the nature and scope of the service activities were more flexible when compared with other service-learning courses. Students could participate in any part of the NGOs’ work, focusing on the process of observation, communication with others, consideration about social issues and the NGOs’ missions, and engagement with the society. With such focus, the NGOs could flexibly arrange manpower and work while the university students could become practical human resources to achieve a win-win situation."

The tasks in the service activities could be diverse. Students could take up the paperwork in the office, prepare and implement a project or directly interact with the service recipients, such as walking with the elderly or farming. In this process, on one hand, students gained different kinds of experiences. Diversified experiences helped students realize that social responsibilities could be fulfilled through a variety of activities and channels. These understandings and experiences motivated students to reflect on how they would do in the future, how they would practise their personal social responsibility in the future and further facilitated students’ willingness to care more about the society.\n\nOn the other hand, students had the opportunity to discover that the NGOs’ jobs were not what they thought. Students, then, realized that there were variety of daily work for the NGOs, including a lot of boring tasks, such as advertisement promotion, sorting envelopes, entering data, and making many phone calls. Students got to know that not all tasks in the NGOs involved a direct contact with the service recipients.

In the mid-term group report, group reports always inspired each other, thus improving students’ later phase of service activities. This was an important part of process assessment.\n\nAs a level-1 course, he hoped that students could see how social resources were allocated, the resources that students had were related to others, and even part of it was from others.

Instructors, thus, can find possible partners inside the resource pool. It will be easier for colleagues who have few contacts with the NGOs.\n\nAnother challenge comes from the time students spend participating in the service. Since the service time will only be calculated when students worked inside the NGOs, there would be time costs involved in completing the service, especially the EdUHK is relatively remote. Some students needed spend 4 hours to do the service activities each time, but the actual service time was only about 1-3 hours."

These two courses were offered by Dr. Patrick Ying Kit YUE, he is from Hong Kong Baptist University.\n\nPrior to taking note of service-learning, Dr. Yue had some insights and explorations on non- traditional teaching methods. He believed that traditional classrooms are often dull and lack of vitality. Instructors talked blindly to the PPT, and students sat in front of the podium and listened tediously. Therefore, in order to break the boredom of the classroom and engaged students in learning, he would try different teaching methods. For example, before implementing service-learning, he worked with the school library and used an online platform to teach some parts of the courses. He hoped to use the online platform to allow students to analyze and learn by themselves, instead of simply listening to him in the classroom.\n\nIn March 2018, Dr. Yue met his colleague Cindy from the Centre for Innovative Service- Learning (CISL) at a teaching sharing meeting. During the conversation, he formally got in touch of the concept of service-learning. Prior to that, he did not know much about the concept and practice of service-learning. However, CISL was willing to assist him in this teaching attempt, and he was also interested in non-traditional teaching methods, so he hit it off and had a service-learning plan later.\n\nIn September 2018, Dr. Yue tried the first time to add the elements of service-learning to his course 'FERMENTATION & ENZYME TECHNOLOGY'. From the drafting of the plan to the implementation of the course, the time is tight yet the support was far from sufficient. 'This is a process of constantly encountering hardship and continuous learning. After all, it is my first time doing it. Before, I did not have any knowledge and experience about service- learning,' Dr. Yue said in the interview. In the course Fermentation, university and secondary school students were paired to work on interactive activities related to fermentation and science.University students designed games and case studies to introduce fermentation and its application to daily lives. In particular, students demonstrated how fermentation could achieve zero food waste and make garbage enzymes for cleaning purposes. The students also designed innovative recipes and prepare snacks that involve the use of fermentation.\n\nDuring the first developmental process about service-learning, Dr. Yue accumulated a lot of experiences, and he knew what needed attention and what needed to be improved, and he applied his learning from these experiences to subsequent developments. By the time the second course was launched in January 2019, he had already been experienced in the design and implementation of the service-learning process. He had re-arranged his practices on motivating students, connecting institutions and controlling time. This course provides general knowledge about toxicology, routes of human exposure to toxic chemicals, and biological responses to toxicants. Students acquired methods for evaluating potential toxicity and applications of toxicological data to assess potential health. To put these theories into practices, students conducted an advocacy campaign in a secondary school with a focus on microplastics.\n\nAfter two attempts, he could have more appreciation and understanding of service- learning. In the future, he stated that he would explore service-learning more."

Then, the content of this part was replaced with service-learning activities. Dr. Yue needed a more appropriate design to link service-learning with the curriculum. For this reason, before the commencement of the first service-learning course, he discussed with the colleagues in CISL many times, and finally decided to work with the social worker Toby, who was recommended by the Faculty of Social Sciences to jointly design the theme activity of 'fermenting life'.\n\nThe service activity was conducted on a Saturday. It comprised three parts. For the first part, Toby was invited to share what was 'fermented life', which he mainly used the concept of 'fermentation' to metaphorize life,that was, the process of 'fermentation' required rigorous procedures for its nurture. Just like life, we needed to accumulate our knowledge well and to carefully handle every important step. The second part was a scientific experiment and it was mainly taught by Dr. Yue, who would teach some simple scientific knowledge about fermentation. The third part was the responsibility of university students. The students would be grouped and they were to prepare a demonstration of fermented food. This process required the students to master the relevant knowledge learned in the classroom, and translated it into applications to allow the secondary school students to learn.\n\nIn the second course, 'Environmental Health and Toxicology', there was a change in the arrangement which the secondary school students and university students would work together to do the presentation. There were seven topics in total, and the discussion would focus on the topics of 'environmental health' and 'toxic food'. In this process, the university students used the knowledge they acquired to assist the secondary school students to do a group display together. It served both a knowledge transfer and an offer of service to the secondary school students. Dr. Yue believed that these learning outcomes could not be achieved by other homework assignments.\n\nPrior to the commencement of service in each of two courses, Dr. Yue would ask the students to write a detailed activity plan and prepared a budget to facilitate the allocation of funds.

In about 2011, service-learning was held as some forms of extra-curricular activities. From 2012 to 2013, the coordinator of this course, who was his PhD supervisor, add some elements of service-learning into the course, such as inviting the elderly to come to the class. Until 2016, the coordinator successfully applied for a two-year UGC’s teaching and learning fund and service-learning could then be formally integrated into the course and which had been running for almost two to three years in 2019.\n\nDr. Cheung mentioned that there were several differences between service-learning held before and after it was integrated into the course curriculum. He continued that firstly, a rubric was developed for this service-learning part of the course now. Before, service- learning was more like internship and some elderly people were invited to class. Under instructors’ guidance, university students would help them conduct body-check for one to two times in the class. In this way, students simply established some medical records. Now, a course document was developed along with the rubric, which accounted for 15% of the course. Secondly, students’ assignment was different after the development of the rubric. The assignment was adjusted from simply preparing medical records to establishing a e-portfolio with the inclusion of service-learning elements such as debriefing and reflective journal which were to be done by students. The nature of the service-learning had also changed. Before, the students only met the elderly once. Now, the students would follow up the elderly cases for the whole year."

It included classroom teaching and a variety of students’ active engagement and learning activities. There were five credits for this course, with four credits for the lecture and one credit for the practice.\n\nThe purpose of the course was to integrate the previously learning from Chinese and Western medicines’ courses into the current (learning) (course) contents. Through this course, students could meet the expectations of acquiring the professional knowledge and skills, and lay a solid foundation for the clinical practice of “bone injuries and massage” in the future. This course aims to enable students to grasp the relevant professional contents of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Practitioner Examination to meet the requirements of Chinese medicine registration. Moreover, it aims to allow students to understand how to further study and develop the skills for lifelong learning.\n\nIn order to integrate the service-learning element into the course, two types of service activities were arranged both in semester one and two: an on-site visit to the elderly home and the invitation of the elderly to visit the university. Specifically, five students formed into one team and each student team was responsible for taking care of one elderly person. One teacher and one social worker joined a student team for giving guidance. From around September to December, each team of five students visited five different elderly people. During the on-site visit, one student of the team who was responsible for the specific elderly person, led the visit and the other four students served as back-up support to check the bone condition of the elderly. Dr. Cheung mentioned that the rationale behind such arrangement was to ensure the safety of the elderly. Another reason was to allow more chances for students to have discussions about the analysis of the problems of the elderly and the identification of the solutions accordingly. By October, all the elderly people were invited to visit the university. The university students, at that time, tried to provide treatment for the elderly to ease their bone pains."

When the elderly came to the campus, students did diagnostic tests and sometimes under teachers’ guidance, had the chance to conduct treatments, which involved Chinese acupuncture, bone- setting massage and etc., to restore the joints’ health of the elderly. Although students could learn how to analyze and perform treatment from the medical courses in small group teaching, many of them felt scared to put what they had learnt into real practice. They might be afraid of communicating with the patients, or even so panic that they forgot things learnt from the book in front of the elderly. Through service-learning, students could have the chance to get down into real practice and overcome their psychological problems. Dr. Cheung also pointed out that the relationship between doctor and patient could never be clearly explained through the classroom teaching. Only through field practice could students have the chance to handle the relationship with the patients. For instance, he mentioned that an elderly person was very dependent on a student that he called the student 6 times to ask questions. The student was very stressful and did not know how to deal with it. However, this situation would apparently happen when the students become a doctor as they need to communicate with patients about their health problems and conditions. Therefore, pre- practice through service-learning allows students to get familiar with ways to handle problems and to some extent, this process facilitates their learning progress as well as preparing them for becoming a doctor."

Through on-site visits, Dr. Cheung wants students to know that as doctors, they should not only be able to heal the patients, but also to get to know their living conditions. Doctors only get to know the patients when they come for consultation. Nevertheless, doctors, sometimes, have no idea of the patients’ situation before and even after the consultation. Dr. Cheung mentioned that in fact, there are many factors influencing the health conditions of a person, for instance, patients’ living environment, their relationship with the family, and their living habits. The concept of the on-site visit is for students to know the elderly’ living conditions and at the same time, to gain access to information about the medicines that they are taking.

The second one was documenting students’ reflection of what they had learned during the service activities, with no provision of guidelines.\n\nA debriefing session was held every semester. Every group of five to six students would also have the debriefing session with the facilitation of two to three teachers. The debriefing lasted from one to one and half hours. Therefore, there were at least two debriefing sessions for every student to discuss their problems related to professional treatment or on-site visits. Dr. Cheung also creatively used mobile apps to follow up students’ problem immediately. He used Whatsapp to create a discussion group for the whole class and even respective discussion groups individually for each group of students.

For the first semester, team-based presentation requires students as a group to share the discussion about a case about an elderly’s health and also things that students have learnt. In the second semester, every student needs to make a e-portfolio. The e-portfolio includes two parts, with one part professionally recording the elderly’s health condition in bones injury and another part completing a reflective journal. For the reflective journal, there are no specific guidelines for the written contents.\nInformal assessment mainly involves social workers to provide written comments based on seven criteria for students’ graduation. The social workers not only act as back-ups to handle the elderly’s health condition after the service, but also participate in giving students’ comments based on their observation. However, Dr. Cheung mentioned that the comments would not be counted into students’ GPA because social workers would be hesitating and nice in evaluation so as not to affect the students. He added that the reasons for engaging the social workers in the assessment were to let students care of the elderly from the perspective of the social workers in addition to that from the doctors. In this way, students’ civic awareness can be raised and they would be more willing to solve problems from the elderly’s perspective. Dr. Cheung hopes that students not only can heal the elderly, but can also stand in the elderly’s shoes, thus promoting their empathy."

He said that he was professional in medical knowledge, however, he lacked a lot of knowledge in other domains, such as educational assessment. CISL, to some extent, helped him to design a rubric for assessment. With the rubric, it was easier for him to give scores, and convince students to understand the importance of service-learning in the course. Another point worth mentioning was that the platform also allowed Dr. Cheung to meet different NGO partners and learn from other teachers’ service-learning course design. For example, Dr. Cheung said that he found out that other courses, such as marketing, creative writing and mathematics, could also integrate service-learning activities. Such exposure enabled him to think outside of the box as a doctor.\nMoreover, he viewed that the platform provided by the CISL facilitated students and teachers to value the significance of the service-learning course. He added that CISL would make posters for each course. With posters, both teachers and students felt that they had ownership of their work. Most importantly, both teachers and students felt that senior managers acknowledged their efforts, which, in turn, facilitated their motivations."

Dr. Xu and Dr. Leung (Ka-wai), with the help of the Student Affairs Office (SAO) in The EdUHK, came to know that the NGO Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (H.K.F.Y.G.) was struggling about the progress of a tutoring program. Specifically, the NGO at that time was implementing a tutoring program with the aim to enhance the learning motivation and autonomy of underprivileged primary school students.\nThe tutors running the program did not have relevant educational background and lacked professional knowledge. Therefore, after some time, they encountered a bottleneck in work progress despite that the program was still running very smoothly. Many primary school students were very poor in English and Mathematics subjects, but the tutors did not know how to improve their knowledge of these subjects. These underprivileged students were less motivated to study at schools as a result.\nAt that time, Miss Leung from EdUHK was running a course “Services for the poor and needy”, which aimed to cultivate university students to be more responsible and to show more empathy for needy people. Another Miss Leung (Connie), from the Language Centre of HKBU, who always led university students to teach English to children who had relatively low language abilities. EdUHK and HKBU thought that it would be a good opportunity for them to collaborate with the NGO to help the needy children. Teachers from the two universities, with their professional expertise, could lead the university students and instill effective teaching theories for tutoring primary school students to have better learning outcomes. The university students could then tutor the homework done by the primary school students while enhancing their hands-on experience related to the two courses that they were taking.

Students who enroll in this course can freely choose one of the parts.\n\nFor the service-learning part in the course, about 30 students will be divided into 5 or 6 groups. Under the arrangement of the course instructor, they would jointly provide consulting services on strategic management for a social enterprise. In this process, students do not need to serve the 'service recipients' directly, but provide 'indirect service' by giving consulting services on strategic management to the social enterprise. 'Students need to use the relevant knowledge of strategic management to help the organization handle some things based on the actual situation of the organization.' Professor Chen explained. The preparatory work process includes:\n\n\t(1) After the semester begins, students will meet with the person in charge of the partner institution to get a preliminary understanding of the institution.\n\t(2) Students visit the institution and conduct simple interviews with customers.\n\t(3) Train students to better understand the characteristics of the institution and service recipients\n\t(4) Students use the knowledge they have learned and provide services to the enterprise according to the specific situation of the enterprise.\n\nIn the non-service-learning part of the course, students also need to conduct activities in groups. The difference is that they need to find a company on their own instead of being arranged by the university. In the whole process, except for a few interviews, the main activity of the students is desk research. Unlike the minimum service hours of 30 hours in the service-learning part, there is no requirement for hours in the non-service-learning part, and no additional training is required in the preparatory stage of the activity.\n\nFor students, there were different unique experiences in the two courses. Professor Chen mentioned that in the service-learning part, students would take on more workload, including the need for additional training and the need to respond to the expectations of partner institutions. However, students could experience more real teaching and learning situations, and carry out more effective reflection. For students who chose the non-service-learning method, it would be more challenging to find a cooperative institution on their own.\n\nProfessor Chen said that compared to 'Strategic Management', the course 'Leadership and Teamwork' will be more open and unstructured. It has the following characteristics:\n\n(1) 'Leadership and teamwork' requires students to provide 'direct service'. For example, in a service which was to cooperate with the Elder Academy, students needed to serve the elderly in person, such as teaching them how to use smartphones.\n(2) This course is still taught in small classes, with 30 students in a class, divided into 6 groups. Unlike 'Strategic Management', this course requires each group to serve a different organization. Professor Chen explained that in the case of 'direct service', the service activities of each institution can accommodate fewer students. For example, in cooperation with the Elder Academy, there were only 8 students in a senior class, while the entire class had 30 university students. A single institution often could not match the number of students in a class of a university.\n(3) The composition of team members will have relatively detailed requirements. Students need to organize teams independently according to their gender, cultural background, language, major, personality (extroverted or introverted) and ability characteristics. Professor Chen explained that because this course is 'Leadership and Teamwork', the consideration of this arrangement is to enable students to adapt to working with people with different characteristics and learn from each other."

Professor Chen said that it was not difficult for students to meet this number of hours because the training time had already accounted for 8 hours. For students who want to do direct service, their extracurricular service time often exceeds 30 hours. As for students who provide indirect services, the time for group meetings and report writing will also be included in the service hours. So in general, such a regulation does not bring much challenge, and students can also benefit from it. For example, they can include service hours in their volunteer hours."

In order to ensure that the registration and questionnaire are completed effectively, the university will link the registration process with the graduation requirement and the student's application of funding for the course. If students fail to complete the registration, the relevant credits for service-learning cannot be registered, nor can they apply for funds in the course. The data for completing the questionnaires will be collected and stored by the Office of Service-learning (OSL). OSL will publish an annual report on service-learning every year."

Specifically, OSL has the network resources of relevant cooperative institutions. OSL will recommend some suitable institutions with reference to the needs of course instructors, and let the instructors choose by themselves. Before the commencement of the semester, if the initial impression of the recommended institution is good, an instructor will discuss with the institution some details, which include the service time and mutual expectations. If the instructor is not satisfied with the selected institution, he can let OSL continue to search and explore. Professor Chen said that through this arrangement, instructors could often find suitable institutions.\n\nAfter the matching is completed, a course instructor needs to undertake more communication work, such as discussing with the institution how to plan specific service arrangements. The follow-up contact with the institution, such as the cooperation with the same institution in the next year, is also the responsibility of the course instructor.\nIn the follow-up process, Professor Chen emphasizes the importance of establishing inter- institutional cooperation instead of interpersonal cooperation. It is because if it is cooperation between individuals, it is difficult to guarantee that the personnel of the organization will not change and this will affect the cooperation. If it is cooperation at the institutional level, newly appointed colleagues are often assigned to take over and be responsible for continuing the project. According to Professor Chen's experience, most of the replacement staff are relatively responsible and will take over the relevant work before the staff leaves."

            text: "Professor Chen said that cooperation with institutions was a two-way selection process. As course instructors, they need to attempt continuously to select and evaluate suitable institutions. In the first few years, Professor Chen tried to cooperate with different institutions which served different service targets. She found that students were more capable to adapt to projects which targeted the elderly, women, and physically handicapped people because these clients could focus more on coping with and participating in activities. For projects that targeted young people and people with mental disabilities, students seemed to be helpless. She believed that the reason might be that students did not have sufficient knowledge and ability in developmental psychology to solve the problems of such service targets, so it was difficult to understand the logic behind their behaviors.\n\nBesides the selection, she believed that she should keep an open mind about her partners. For a while, she had not tried to cooperate with institutions that served the disabled, but after working with the AIDS Association, she found that the cooperation was smooth and effective. However, she also mentioned that although she wanted to try new cooperation opportunities, she 'doesn’t take too much steps at once.' That is to say, if you encounter an organization with smooth cooperation, you may wish to develop a long-term cooperative relationship. Cooperating with a familiar organization can greatly reduce the cost of running- in. Especially, in the 'Leadership and Teamwork' course, when the instructor needed to communicate with five organizations, the workload was quite heavy. 'If we can keep the three experienced organizations to continue cooperating in the second year, the workload will be reduced a lot and there will be more time to contact two new organizations,' Professor Chen explained."

For example, in 'Strategic Management', there was an institution that wanted students to do market surveys. Professor Chen designed the service based on this expectation. After setting five different perspectives, the five teams implemented their plans separately. In the reflection phase, each group could consult the institution from a different perspective. In addition, the questionnaire could also be divided into five aspects and each group was responsible for one aspect. Finally after discussion, ideas were consolidated into a questionnaire for implementation. When the data was retrieved, each team could analyze it from a different perspective."

The training it provides is mainly be divided into two parts, one is more generic, and another part is for courses. For example, in a whole day of training, it would be about general knowledge and skills in the morning, and it would be based on the characteristics of the course itself in the afternoon. “OSL is very flexible. Many of our teachers' requirements for training can basically be met.“ Professor Chen said, “They are very professional. In the training session, I only need to put forward my expectations. They will try their best to provide assistance.” For example, Professor Chen had tried to organize courses to serve ethnic minorities. OSL then provided training similar to a cultural tour, taking students to visit mosques, tasting local food, and helping students understand their culture. In addition, OSL also provided training on the elderly and environmental protection topics, and had invited experts in related fields to share and talk."

For example, for a fund-raising project for HIV patients, if it is only raising money, some students will find it not meaningful. What the instructor needs to do is to find a way to let the students understand the meaning behind.\nIn this regard, Professor Chen mainly considers two points: First, closely integrate the service with the curriculum, so that students feel that participating in the service can help them get high scores in their academic work. At least in the academic work, participating in the service is meaningful, which can promote their participation; the second is to make association with students' learning goals. The instructor must understand the students' learning goals and let them know that their participation in the project can benefit them and help them achieve their own goals."

According to her observation, there are three main learning goals for students:\n\n\t(1) Being instrumental, that is, it is helpful to oneself. For example, if students want to understand their grandmother's ideas and improve their relationship with her, they may choose to participate in service projects related to the elderly. For another example, some students hope to join the education industry in the future, so in order to enrich their experience, they will also choose projects related to youth education.\n\t(2) Being non-instrumental, starting from one's own interests. For example, because some students are interested in education, they will choose youth education services to learn more about students.\n\t(3) To meet graduation requirements. In LU, undergraduate students must choose at least one service-learning course at the enrollment stage. The university will start recommending the students to consider choosing relevant courses at their first year undergraduate study. However, according to Professor Chen's experience, there will always be a small number of students who are forced to choose a service-learning course at the end of the undergraduate programme, but most students, at least 95% of students,\nShe said that when she first came to Lingnan University, students were very resistant to service learning. The main reason might be that the workload of service learning was relatively heavy, but after that many years, students had improved their acceptance level of service learning.

Students could ask him questions based on the problems encountered in their assignments. During that process, OSL would help to produce meeting minutes and distributed them to students afterwards. As for the 'Leadership and Teamwork' course, there were many cooperative organizations. It was impossible to invite all organization representatives. She had no choice but to do her best. If all the agency representatives were unable to attend, she would ask some questions in class with reference to the students' projects, let the students think and answer them, and let them give a small presentation. In this way, not only peer pressure could be exerted to urge each group to supervise each other, but could also discover some common problems, which the group could understand and overcome, thereby reducing some self-attribution frustrations sense.\nAt the end of the term, Professor Chen would let the students of 'Strategic Management' conduct self-reflection, and let the students of 'leadership and teamwork' add a team reflection on the basis of self-reflection.

Professor Chen believes that this grading method is in line with the essence of 'indirect service', that is, 'consulting', and it also conforms to the course outline.\nIn the 'Leadership and Teamwork' course, due to the large number of service agencies, instructors cannot participate in the 'direct service' of students every time to see their performance, so the evaluation of student service performance is mainly based on their reflection and report. Professor Chen said that there might be elements of falsification in reflections and reports. She has also considered letting partner institutions grade students, but for now, the grading method is still mainly based on oral presentations, reflections and written reports. There are three reasons:\n\n\t(1) The identity of the cooperating institution is always an outside person, and it is difficult for students and instructors to agree to the grading power given to external personnel.\n\t(2) If institutional partners are involved in grading, students will worry that the relationship between themselves and the staff of the institution will affect the results of the grading.\n\t(3) The scores of different institutional partners have different subjectivity, and it is difficult to guarantee the fairness of the scores.\n\nHowever, in the 'direct service', Professor Chen will still try to participate in and communicate with students, and at the same time design a series of approaches to help herself evaluate the quality of student service which include:\n\n\t(1) Students are required to hold a group meeting once a week and record the process in a report. The instructor can see the content of the group meeting and the participation level of group members.\n\t(2) The student's service content outline and presentation PowerPoint must be submitted to the instructor.

Professor Chen believes that this is often caused by the fact that the assessment does not fit the actual situation well. Instructors need to constantly adjust the evaluation methods and content to fill in the gaps in evaluation. For example, in the initial evaluation, she did not require students to hold group meetings and record the content of the meetings, but only to evaluate the general performance of students through peer review. However, from the results, this process would miss lot of information, so she later added a series of measures to fill the gaps, including:\n\n\t(1) Hold a group meeting once a week, record the attending students, and submit the meeting minutes. As to how to write meeting minutes, Professor Chen will explain in class.\n\t(2) Submit the PPT about the service content, and let the students explain the execution logic and personal thinking in the report and personal reflection. This not only allows instructors to understand the service situation more effectively, but also improves the quality of service for students.\n\nIn addition, if the final examination can be well integrated with the service itself, it can also fill in some assessment gaps and increase student participation. For example, if the final test is set as a case analysis, if students fail to participate in the service-learning project well and do not have their own personal experience, they will not be able to understand and analyze the case well in the final examination, and the score will be relatively low.

If a faculty member is unable to have publications consistently and steadily, then he needs to work hard for gaining the practices, such as consulting or being company executives, or carrying out service-learning projects, etc., in order to gain recognition from the university. Under this policy, for non-long-term contract teachers and teachers who have not yet gained certain academic achievements, developing service-learning is a relatively simple way to gain recognition. For teachers who have obtained long-term contracts and academic recognition, there may be two main factors that motivate them to carry out service- learning and these are to help their teaching and not to bring them extra or too much burden.\nIn addition, Professor Chen also believes that if there is university support, the threshold for faculty to participate in service-learning will be lowered.

Therefore, LU does not lack network resources in terms of institutional cooperation.\nWhen Professor Chen first came to LU, as a young faculty member, she was not familiar with service learning. At that time, OSL provided her with greater help. The following\n\n(1) Provide service-learning practice guidance (Mentoring): Most of the OSL staff have experience working with teachers in service-learning, and can directly give teachers advice on the implementation of service-learning.\n(2) Provide assistance in human resources: OSL helps to arrange interviews between students and service recipients, field trips and related consultation activities.\n(3) Help faculty and staff to establish a cooperative network (Networking): Professor Chen explained that OSL itself is also a teaching department that will teach some courses, so it will accumulate some cooperative resources. When teachers lack cooperative resources, they can seek help from OSL.\n(4) Provide funds: The financial assistance here is mainly used to purchase training courses and for daily expenses of the group. The daily expenses of the group include transportation and the purchase of activity materials, etc. 'The total cost will not be much and it is about HK$10,000 to 20,000 each course.' Professor Chen said.\n(5) Provide a discussion platform for service learning: There is a committee on service learning in OSL, which is responsible for reviewing all service-learning courses and conducting related discussions. 'For example, if I want to open a new service-learning course, or if I make change to a course, then we will exchange opinions on this discussion platform. We can also discuss policies on service-learning.'

For example, in the course of serving the elderly, because there were not enough elderly participants, students needed to do posters and road shows to attract elderly\n\n(5) Different cooperative institutions had different expectations for the number of services provided by students.

Then, students would complain and feel that different times of service would affect their final evaluation results. In this regard, Professor Chen would try to communicate and maintain balance, and would also explain to students that the final evaluation was not an evaluation of the entire project, but the process of service.

A practical approach was adopted to arouse the curiosity and interest of the students in the subject in order to stimulate critical scientific thinking. The course addressed the basic chemistry and biochemistry of vital components for the living cell.

A practical approach is adopted to arouse the curiosity and interest of the students in the subject in order to stimulate critical scientific thinking. With Dr. Fong’s connection, he managed to cooperate with the Ocean Park Hong Kong (香港海洋公園) (hereafter called the Ocean Park). Different from other courses which aimed to serve the elderly, in this “Life” course, students and the elderly went together to the Ocean Park to teach the visitors some knowledge about biology, such as shark and conservation. The Ocean Park wanted the visitors to learn more about knowledge of ocean protection. The practical experience for students not only help them broaden their knowledge scope, but also address life issues competently and with confidence. The intergeneration service activities allowed students to change their views towards the elderly and to learn more from them."

Prior to the service-learning, he was planning to partner with a primary school. However, there were 35 students in his course and it was impossible that all of them came to teach in only one primary school. It would also become complicated if students were allocated to different schools and handled different projects and in such regard, Dr. Fong was concerned with the complexity of supervising different projects in one service-learning course. Therefore, he tried to look for existing activities that were of large scales yet very well-structured that students could just join to do service-learning. At that time, he had some friends working in the Ocean Park and they happened to have some projects that they could work together with Dr. Fong.\n\nAfter the confirmation of the partnership, students came to the Ocean Park and took up the roles to deliver the activities designed by the Ocean Park. Due to time constraint, Dr. Fong did not ask students to design the activities.\n\nAlso, he believed that his service-learning project could be delivered smoothly if he could integrate his course content into the structured programme already been available in Ocean Park. As a matter of fact, the Ocean Park had fruitful experience in organizing these activities. Moreover, most of the partners in the Ocean Park used to study in Lingnan University, and therefore they were familiar with the courses and students’ situation."

The addition of service-learning component in this course, to some extent, would be more attractive to students because through doing services, students experienced how they could apply what they had learnt from the class into reality and this even facilitated their understanding of the knowledge taught in class.\n\nFor instance, many tourists in the Ocean Park would come up with different questions that students, with insufficient background knowledge, could not answer immediately. Therefore, during breaks, the students would initiate to look for the answers by themselves through the internet. They would put more efforts in answering the tourists’ questions, which, in return, helped them develop self-learning habits. This learning process further facilitated their understanding of the learning contents."

This interaction time enhanced their relationship.\n\nDr. Fong added that the intergenerational learning experience also facilitated students to reflect on their behaviors. For example, most of the students were very shy during service- learning activities. After seeing that the elderly was very active in participation, students tended to do more reflections later on.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Fong mentioned that many students felt that the intergenerational learning experience changed their mindset towards the elderly.

        content: "Case 12 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled “News Writing” (Hereinafter referred to as Writing). This course was offered by Prof. Siu Yan-ho, he is from Lingnan University.\n\nProf. Siu Yan-ho first came into contact with service-learning in 2015. At that time he worked with a professor to teach the course 'Classical Fiction'. With the collaboration with the Elder Academy, this course uses the method of “life retrospective narrative, and combines literary creation and interviews to help students understand the process of literary creation. During this process, Dr. Siu gains a lot of experience in service-learning, including how to cooperate with organizations, the formulation of processes and goals, the guidance of writing, and conducting interviews. The accumulation of these experiences has helped him follow up the development of service-learning courses in the future.\n\nIn 2016-2017, Dr. Siu started to independently teach a service-learning course, namely 'news writing'. This course inherited the interview and writing model of 'classical novels'. The service target was still mainly the elderly. It was launched with the theme of 'Hong Kong in 1950' and with the purpose to integrate the interview writing knowledge acquired in the classroom and service-learning, and to let students practice what they had learned. He said that there were three main reasons for the choice of the theme of interviewing the elderly and Hong Kong in 1950: First, Dr. Siu was interested in the study of Hong Kong literature and culture after the World War II, that is, after 1950. However, there was a lack of relevant information during that period and little could be understood. Through the survey through interview with the elderly, this missing part of the research data could be supplemented; second, he felt that the elderly of this age group were old and if that was not done at that time, there might not be any chance in the future. In addition, most of the elderly that he had contacted with had primary cognitive impairments. Even if they were in good health, their memory would inevitably deteriorate. Therefore, it would be better to do interviews and conduct surveys promptly with this group of old people whenever possible. Third, Dr. Siu believed that the history of Hong Kong in the 1950s and 1960s should be retained. He treated the retention of such history his personal responsibility to the Hong Kong community. He felt that this historical memory was precious and important to the interviewed elders, their families and communities.\n\nIn 2017-2018, Dr. Siu continued to work with the elderly centre in Hung Shui Kiu, but the theme was changed to 'Hong Kong in 1960' because the university wanted the instructors to present different courses. In addition, he had also increased the cooperation with other organizations, and the service target was still the elderly. The other organizations included were about food therapy services with the School of Chinese Medicine of Hong Kong Baptist University, co-organizing an exhibition of an era with Tai Kwun, and he also tried to move to Taiwan to have practice and to further enrich the curriculum model and outputs."

The service-learning module is also known as the 'new writing service research plan' and it mainly contains two major parts, namely 'interview with people' and 'local topics'. In the 'interview with people' part, the students will form a group of two, and each group will interview an elderly to understand his life in Hong Kong in the 1950s, and gradually explore and understand the events experienced by the elderly and the related cultural context behind them. In the 'local topics' part, students had to have a deep understanding of the local community, including the need for field trips, discovering problems, collecting and integrating data, etc., and then discussing local issues through text, presenting the development of community history and the changes past and present.\n\nThe specific course content and arrangement are as follows:\n\n\t(1) Historical research: Students investigate and understand the background in the early stage before the service delivery, which helps the offering of the services that follow. For example, to communicate with the staff of the elderly center to understand the background of the elderly prior to the 'interview with people', or to pay field visit and collect information during the exploration of the 'local topic'.\n\n\t(2) Visits: Students have to conduct three interviews with the elders. For the first time, it aims to get acquainted with the elders and establish a relationship with them. The second visit is to define the scope of research, service and the subsequent articles. In the third visit, the students should have established a clear theme. Through interviews, the writing materials will be supplemented, or more detailed materials can be obtained orally, so that more in-depth character descriptions or plot narratives can be achieved.\n\n\t(3) Consultation interviews: Students need to conduct four consultation meetings with their instructors individually or in groups. They have to report the status of the visit and the difficulties encountered to the instructors to help them to understand the needs of the students and make corresponding adjustments.\n\n\t(4) Field visit: The staff members of the elderly centre would leads the students to enter the community to gain insight into the local community culture and history.\n\n\t(5) Results sharing: This includes class discussion and sharing, sharing of results and some follow-up activities. In the classroom discussion and sharing, everyone will study the difficulties and value in the service-learning process; in the results sharing session, the elderly, center staff and colleagues in service-learning will be invited, and the instructors will listen to the students' report on the learning results, and give comments ; and in the follow-up activities, that is, after the book about 'personal interview' has been compiled, the results of service-learning will be shared and passed on to the public in press conferences, exhibitions and other activities."

At the beginning, many elders would say, “I am old. There is nothing special in life and nothing special to be interviewed.” However, during the interview, the students’ attention to and affirmation of the experiences of the elders could help them enhance their confidence and re-examine the value and meaning of their life.\n\nDr. Siu believes that people who do not necessarily do great things to be heroes, as long as they live wonderfully, they are heroes.

Problems arise, mostly because the students lacked preparation before the interview, or the publicity and coordination work of the partner organization was not good enough.\n\n<i>Preparatory workshops</i>\n\nIn the early stage of the course, there were two workshops about “communication skills” and “Hong Kong culture”. Colleagues from OSL would explain the concepts of service-learning and interview methods at the first workshop. In addition, staff of the elderly center would be invited to introduce the service targets and the skills of getting along with the elderly.

Third, the students would reflect fully during the results sharing session and to rethink their relationship with the elderly.\n\nIn the early stage of the course, students can choose to participate in the service-learning part or non-service-learning part of 'news writing'. In the service-learning part, fixed interview subjects and themes had been set up, namely, the elderly in Hung Shui Kiu and 'Hong Kong in 1950'. In the non-service-learning part, there was no rigidly designated interview subject. The participating students could choose the interview subject and writing theme by themselves. In addition, there were specific requirements for the number of consultation meetings for service-learning students, but not for non-service-learning students. Dr. Siu explained that the reason for setting up this requirement was that students were not familiar with the elders and the interview difficulty was relatively high. The three consultations were required to ensure the support of the instructors to the students and the quality of the course. For students who participate in non-service-learning part, most of them would find people whom they knew well or friends as interview subjects, so the interview arrangement was relatively easy.

However, some colleagues also reported that it was extremely unpleasant to cooperate with the institution and the elderly. Therefore, the instructors and the representative of the partner institution should have a good communication before the operation of the service-learning project.\n\n<i>Cooperation with other universities</i>\n\nDr. Siu had collaborated with the School of Chinese Medicine of the Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) in a service-learning course, combining 'personal interviews' with 'Chinese medicine diet'. This joint effort allowed students of LU to be responsible for interviewing the elderly and students of HKBU could then provide dietary treatment plan based on interview content. However, there were some challenges in this process:\n\n\t(1) The setting of the curriculum separated the content that the students of the two universities were responsible for. Specifically, there was little overlap in the content of the responsibilities of the students of the two universities, resulting in less communication between the two parties, and there was no exchange of interview knowledge and Chinese medicine knowledge. The measure taken by Dr. Siu was to add additional workshops to give Lingnan students the opportunity to learn more about Chinese medicine.\n\t(2) The schedule of the two universities needed to be adjusted.

This was a separate project with no credit requirements. Students who had participated in 'news writing' service-learning would be recruited. According to Dr. Siu’s observation, students were more open to non-credit projects than courses with credit requirements. Specifically, in credit courses, homework is linked to scores and many of the students' considerations will be about test scores, such as the accuracy of words used and the level of detail in descriptions. The advantage of this is that they can well constrain and regulate their own output, but the disadvantage is that the choice of topics and the use of sentences will be more conservative, with fewer breakthroughs and innovations. In a separate project, students would have a more personal style of using sentences, and the choice of topics was also related to their interests. Taking the latter as an example, upon the students’ arrival in Taiwan, they chose various topics, such as the reconstruction of Taipei Twin Island, community pollution or transportation.\n\nIn addition, in Taiwan, the time period for individual projects was short and services were more concentrated. In a relatively unfamiliar and isolated environment, students could be more engaged. In Hong Kong, the student engagement and concentration were often disturbed by various other affairs, such as other courses, meetings, and other homework."

In 2016, the previous course instructor asked Dr Lam whether she was interested in leading the course, and she has officially been responsible for the course ITC2S01 since then. At that time, it was the only service-learning course in the department. To increase the number of such courses, Dr Lam revised the content of ITC2S01 and added other elements to create a new course, ITC2S02, which began in 2017. According to Dr Lam, one major difference between the two courses is that ITC2S01 mainly involves conducting service for the disabled, whereas ITC2S02 aims at conducting service with the service recipients through a co-design process.\nFrom her observations since 2015, Dr Lam realised that many service recipients, while taking part in the service activities of the course, treated the students as though they were there to serve the disabled recipients – effectively placing ‘orders’ by asking the students to make particular clothes. In her opinion, both parties should benefit from the service-learning process and should encourage each other. The co-design process allowed the service recipients to get involved. With some guidance, the service recipients could devote effort to the course activities according to their capabilities. For instance, those with a talent for drawing could draw pictures on the cloth for the students to work with when making clothes. ‘The rationale for the co-design process was to encourage interaction between the students and the service recipients’, Dr Lam said. For instance, students could ask the service recipients about their hobbies. The students could then use the clothes they were designing as a basis for storytelling. In Dr Lam’s vision, the course was not essentially about the product but about helping the service recipients express their thoughts.\nDr Lam relates that many NGO partners have given positive feedback, telling her that the co-design process gave the service recipients a newfound sense of empowerment as they would never have thought they could successfully make their own clothes."

Through the lectures, the course instructor conveyed the knowledge and skills specific to the practice of expressive textile arts. Dr Lam presented some literature to the students and explained in academic terms how the interventions involving expressive textile arts benefit different service recipients. The students also came to understand the rationales behind the concepts and their functions.\nAfter the students had acquired these basic concepts, they moved on to the service-learning project to develop their practical skills by working together with the service recipients. These were people with various special needs, such as underprivileged children and women, single parents, and people recovering from mental illness. All of the artworks arising from the co-design process were recorded. Given that the service recipients needed to get involved in the co-design process. The service-learning project, which allowed service recipients to get involved in co-design, ran in semester three from mid-May to July. During these one and a half months, the students spent 40 hours spread across 5 weeks in direct contact with the recipients.\nA styling presentation with photo-shoot sessions was conducted as part of the service, during which the service recipients modelled their own expressive textile artworks.

She had eight teaching assistants to observe the students on-site and carry out the assessment, for instance, by recording the students’ punctuality, absenteeism and preparation. Not all students in a group got the same scores. The teaching assistants based the scores on their observations and also asked the students which types of work they were responsible for to get a clear picture of their roles in the team, and gave scores according to each individual’s performance in the team.\nFor the quality of the deliverables, the assessment factors included the expressive textile artworks themselves and the styling presentation or mini fashion show/static exhibition. These reflected the students’ understanding of the discipline-specific concepts, their role and responsibilities as a professional, and their ability to communicate effectively and empathise with their service recipients. Dr Lam conducted the assessment based on two perspectives: the preparation of the clothing items and the service recipients’ responses. She would ask the service recipients about the clothes-making process to make sure that it was a collaborative co-design process.

After this introduction, the social workers took the service recipients to another room to rest and then gave the students a guided tour of the building. Another social worker began the seminar. As well as interpersonal skills, they mentioned particular things to pay attention to when the students interacted with the service recipients. For instance, they should avoid mentioning certain things when dealing with specific individuals. The NGO made notes of ‘taboo’ subjects related to each service recipient and distributed them to the students according to the service recipients they were assigned to take care of. \nDr Lam emphasised how important it was for the NGO to brief the students on interpersonal skills. For instance, in the third year of running the course, 10 service recipients with learning difficulties were involved in the programme. Unlike the other service recipients, they were unable to express themselves verbally, which presented a huge challenge for the students. \nTo involve those service recipients in the co-design process, the NGO suggested that the students use the method of leading, instead of offering suggestions, in the co-design process. One 70-year-old woman suffering from severe mental retardation particularly impressed Dr Lam. She did not have a long attention span and needed to nap every 15 minutes. This required patience from the students. Using the leading method, the students cut some flowers for the elderly service recipient, who then used a sponge roller to print out the flower. Although her hands shook while printing, the elderly woman enjoyed this process so much that she immediately wrapped the cloth around her neck as if it were a scarf. Seeing this, the students realised that although she could not express her thoughts, she could show her emotions through action. This new form of expression was very novel for the students."

This course was offered by Dr. Chan Hin Wang Kevin, he is from the department of Applied Social Sciences of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nThe course Community Psychology started from 2011. At that time, the course was run as a pilot service-learning course for the three-year curriculum students as a general education elective. The reason for constructing it as a service-learning module was that Dr. Chan wanted to use the service-learning pedagogy to serve the course purpose. Specifically, the course required students to not only learn theory and knowledge about how people behave in a community, but also take corresponding actions to change the community. Only through a service-learning module can students fully grasp the community psychology properly. The pilot service-learning course had attained positive achievement. Therefore, this course commenced as a subject of the four-year curriculum. Later, it has been categorized as one of the service-learning subjects and the course has been offered to the students who take this four-year new curriculum, contributing to their achieving the general university requirements, which involve thirty credits of the class subject to service learning, the interpersonal leadership and etc.\n\nCommunity Psychology includes three modules of learning: Lectures/workshops, e-learning and first-hand community service. It was a small class size enrolled with 24-40 university students.\n\n\ta. Lectures/workshops are designed to equip students with the discipline-specific knowledge, including health promotion and prevention, empowerment, and sense of community and social capital. Some intervention targeting at community health, individual’s wellness and civic society at higher level will also be introduced.\n\tb. Students need to attend 10-hour e-learning module developed and delivered by the Office of Service Learning at PolyU, which aims to introduce basic concepts and practice of service-learning. Students are required to complete the e-learning module within the first four weeks of the semester.\n\tc. For gaining the first-hand community service experience, students can participate in either a health promotion or a child development program. Within the program, the students are expected to work closely with the collaborative agency to deliver a range of tasks and activities to the service recipients. The students would be divided into teams of around five persons. Each team are required to participate in home visitation, specific tasks assigned by the service agency and design activity according to the community and service needs."

Through home visitation, students would be exposed to and get to know about the community. For example, going through home visitation routine allows students to get first-hand experience about what a unit in an old building estate looks like; what does a singleton elderly home look like; what does a two senior couple only with one domestic helper look like; what it was like to step into a home of an ethnic minority.\n\nFor the second section, university students would be helping out some community activities organized by the service partner, such as a community health fair, or the seniors-organized or senior-let activities on recreational exercise. Being a passive role in those activities allows students to reflect on their role and responsibilities both as a professional in their chosen discipline and as a responsible citizen.\n\nFor the third section, students needed to design one activity for the seniors, which would be on the need or topic that the seniors wanted the most. Students could choose whatever format or style they wanted for the activity. They had to plan the activities. Usually, the course teacher would give them a list of hot topics or prioritized needs in the community.

Take PolyU students as an example, they would have a lot of commitments, such as doing part-time jobs, and preparing quizzes on Saturdays. With students having heavy schedule at school (university), course leaders should set different and diverse spectrum of community services with varying degrees of skills and time commitment required for students to have the flexibility to choose the timeslot according to their timetable.\n\nNevertheless, Dr. Chan put forward that there must be a good balance between enough diversity and unified and feasible service offering for the students. He added that too much diversity would not only drain students’ energy, but also the teaching team, the service NGO and the recipients. Therefore, striking a balance, such as having a personalized or tailored service packages, would save a lot of financial and time resources from the NGO as well as time from the recipients."

Different from other service-learning courses, his course involves assessment from multiple assessors. That is, both course lecturer and on-site supervisors would assess students. In order to maintain the consistency among different assessors, he requires assessors to grade students based on the rubric. The service rubric has clearly outlined several key components, such as professionalism, punctuality, commitment to the community service and to what extent they would exhibit their sincere concern on the service recipients. Dr. Chan would give students brief descriptions on each service assessment as well as the requirement of other assessment forms, such as reflective journal and paper assessment.\n\nFor individual performance, Dr. Chan could assess students from their reflective journals or essays submitted after the service-learning activities. The reasons of collecting their reflective journals or essays were to know how well students blended theories learnt in class coverage of subject matter and practice in their community service-learning experience. Quizzes were set as part of the course work, aiming at consolidating students’ comprehension of the essential and content knowledge blocks in the respective units. The questions were based on the weekly required reading and the lecture. Students were required to attend a number sessions of e-learning module developed and delivered by the Office of Service-Learning in PolyU to learn basic concepts and practice of service-learning.\n\nAnother issue is that with diverse portfolio of tasks, students’ satisfaction could be easily achieved. For example, some students might be very enthusiastic but they only have limited effort to invest time in a task due to their heavy workload at school. In this case, course teachers should set up a diverse portfolio of task that students at varying levels of competence can somehow meet the requirements of the tasks and get satisfaction and sense of competence after accomplishing the tasks"

He has already sorted another two to three visiting associates with strong human service and social work or community background to come and form a team.\n\nDr. Chan also mentioned that for overseas service-learning, only one junior instructor or teaching fellow is impossible to complete a successful overseas project. That is because, there might involve not only teaching, but also communication and administration work. Dr. Chan gave an example of a project led by his colleague in mainland.

He tried to tell the students to set lower requirement because it was unreasonable to have high demand on students who were not registered social workers."

Since then, there have been changes in the activity modes of the course and the backgrounds of students, and thus the types of training provided have also been changed.\n\nAt the beginning, the course was open only to students with a science and engineering background. The course quota was approximately 60 students, and approximately 30– 40 students enrolled each year. In 2013, however, the course was opened to all students, which resulting in 100 student enrolling. In the opinion of Dr Lau, this increase was beneficial because enabled more service-learning activities to performed than was possible with fewer students. The recipients of service were students from secondary schools, and the number of participating schools increased from one to eight. This increase in the number of service recipients resulted in more faculty members and university students joining the course to perform various service-learning projects. Over the years, these service-learning projects were continually revised to ensure that they were linked to the course curriculum and met the practical needs of the community.\n\n"

Dr Lau explained that he reduced the teaching hours to enable the students to be more involved in and thus gain more knowledge from their service-learning projects. Dr Lau invited students to learn through experience by participating in the service-learning activities. Dr Lau pointed out that the type of teaching depended on the nature of the service-learning activities; for example, more training was provided to enhance the professional skills of students who were to be involved in service activities to monitor people’s health conditions. Nevertheless, students did not generally require specific professional knowledge to perform the activities, but rather theoretical knowledge. Their main tasks were to review the knowledge acquired by S1 and S2 secondary school students and determine how they could have taught this knowledge to the secondary school students in an interesting way."

Therefore, Dr Lau ensured that each team of university students had one or two students with an engineering background. In this way, each team had a wide range of professional knowledge and expertise, which enhanced its efficiency and effectiveness in the activities. For instance, students with an engineering background were expected to show a team how to assemble machine components; those with an educational background were expected to instruct a team on classroom- management; and those with a business background were expected to demonstrate to a team the appropriate use of business terms. This exchange of knowledge between different types of students widened their perspective and created a mutually beneficial learning platform."

Since 2013, when the number of enrolled students increased, the SLLO had provided two to four instructors to support the course. When five secondary schools hosted service activities on the same day and at the same time, three to four instructors were required for the supervision of the activities. At each secondary school, an instructor and a teaching assistant worked together to coordinate the activities. Dr Lau emphasised that the course would have not been effective without the support of these instructors.\n\nThe SLLO instructors supervised the university students as they ran the service- learning activities, guided the students to perform self-assessments and scored their on- site performance. Each instructor was encouraged to supervise a specific group of students throughout the entire process to ensure consistency in the student performance assessments. The instructors were also encouraged to record details of any interesting events during the service-learning activities. A continuous interchange of supervisors between schools would not have provided a detailed overview of the entire process. For example, if the supervisors had remained in each school for only one day at a time, there would be no day-to-day background information on occurrences, such as arguments. The supervisors also taught some classes about team building and communication skills; however, due to budget restrictions, Dr Lau took over this teaching role in the last years of service-learning activities.\n\nThe SLLO instructors worked based on the hours required by the course instructors.

Students were prepared for this by being shown videos on how to (and how not to) interact with the elderly, and by practising such interactions by role-playing. Consequently, they improved their communication skills. In addition, when students visited various community centres and had personal interactions with elderly residents, they developed a deep understanding of the living conditions and community environment of these residents, and were able to practice conversing with them. All of this was excellent training.\n\nThe Paths course was somewhat structured, in that students were also taught acupuncture points and massage (including instruction in the hands-on body technique known as tuīná), and then provided these services to elderly clients.

Thus, they must be taught in accordance with their aptitude and the actual situations they are likely to encounter.

Dr Yue thus used examples to teach students the practical utility of Chinese medicine, such as how to apply acupuncture at hegu (合谷) points to treat headaches and at fengchi (風池) points to treat colds, which immediately relieves the discomfort of clinical symptoms. Students were invariably delighted to learn these techniques to help themselves and their family members and friends, and no doubt became very popular as a result!\n\nDr Yue clarifies that in addition to the Paths course being designed for students, it had to teach them how best to serve those in need of health services. That is, in addition to helping students to gain satisfaction from learning well, we must also ensure that this learning will enable them to contribute to the community.\n\nFurthermore, service learning teaches students how to help beyond the boundaries of a community. Thus, the Paths course empowered students to broaden their horizons and apply what they had learned about providing services in any area of their life.\n\nDr Yue understands that each student has a different learning start-point and thus a different level of commitment to learning, which means that students’ learning progress varies.

As such, the teachers’ key tasks in the Path course were to master the other aspects of service learning they needed to teach to students, including specialised skills such as acupuncture and massage. Five or six teachers and registered Chinese medicine practitioners closely guided and monitored the students’ provision of these specialised services to elderly clients, as students might not have been able to answer all of the questions asked by the clients.\n\nDr Yue led by example by accompanying students into the community and actively communicating about their experience, feelings and thinking with students. He was also involved when students were providing services by themselves, rather than in a group.
