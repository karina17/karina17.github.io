          "Case 1 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled “Promotion of Children and Adolescent Development” (Hereinafter referred to as Children). This course was offered by Dr. YU Lu, she is from the department of Applied Social Sciences of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nThe course expects students to be able to 1) critically examine the different perspectives of child and adolescent development and apply the concepts in understanding the needs and potentials of underprivileged children and adolescents in the community, 2) integrate knowledge on child and adolescent development into real life situations through service delivery, 3) apply the discipline specific knowledge and skills (such as engagement and communication skills with children and adolescents) to deal with complex issues in the service setting, 4) reflect on their roles and responsibilities both as a professional in their chosen discipline and as a responsible citizen, 5) cultivate the positive values and strengths orientation, 6) cultivate civic responsibilities and prosocial behaviors, 7) develop the sense of care and compassion towards other people, especially the underprivileged children and adolescents in the community, 8) enhance self-confidence, problem solving and decision-making capabilities, 9) enhance the social competence and interpersonal skills through collaboration with the partners, partnered agencies, parents and service targets.\n\nThe course Children runs across two semesters - spring semester and summer semester. In the spring semester, students were required to complete a 10-hour online course on basic concepts and practice of service-learning, such as principles, concepts and research of service-learning), benefits of service-learning to the service users, the community, the students and the university, the ethical issues, effective teamwork and problem solving skills in service-learning, reflection as a tool for learning discipline-specific concepts.\n\nIn the spring semester, the course also included one lesson on the course content and three lessons on theories related to the development of children and adolescents. Each lesson lasted for three hours, including 1) lectures and seminars for acquiring discipline-specific knowledge, including developmental theories of child and adolescent development, ecological model of human development, positive youth development model, the strengths model of intervention, 3) seminars for equipping themselves with the project-specific skills such as engagement and communication skills of children and adolescents, ways to promote their competence, assessment of child and adolescent development, generic service planning, delivery and evaluation etc., 4) small group discussion and workshops for students to develop a service curriculum for the underprivileged children and adolescents, to share moral and ethical issues, service delivery skills and classroom management and through which students develop their teamwork capability. At the workshops about service activities, the course instructors guided the university students as to how to design instructional programs and to acquire basic teaching skills. For example, there would be lesson on how to stimulate primary school students’ interest and motivation in learning and on strategies to engage them in classroom learning. The university students were free to choose specific teaching topics based on their experiences and interests.\n\nAfter that, they joined a 10-day tour and complete a service-learning project in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xi’an in Mainland China. During these ten days’ period, they have preparations before service in the first two days, and then the service activities were held in a primary school in the next five days. The day after the service activities, the course instructors organized the sixth workshop to help students consolidate what they had learned. Upon returning to Hong Kong, the students were also required to have a group presentation at their final workshop."

              "For running this Children course, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) cooperated with Zhejiang University in Mainland China to launch the service activities in a primary school in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. The primary school was set up by the local government mainly for the migrant children who were born elsewhere in China and their parents were working in Hangzhou.\n\nThe students from the PolyU who took the Children course traveled to Hangzhou during the summer semester and provided a five-day service in the primary school. They were mainly engaged in teaching activities for the primary school students. During the service period, the research students of Zhejiang University participated in classroom observation and group discussions after class, and shared their observations and opinions.\n\nThis Children course emphasized rich and effective communication with the service partner. The counterparts of Zhejiang University initially made contact with the primary school. After the clarifications of the cooperation intention and before meeting directly with partners in the primary school, the course instructors sent the service plan to the school principal for advice and suggestions. The service plan covered:\n- What did the PolyU plan to do?\n- Whether the expectations and proposed service arrangement of the PolyU were reasonable?\n- In the opinion of the primary school, was it appropriate to do so?\n- Could it be achieved in the current school environment?\n- What were the expectations of the primary school from PolyU and Zhejiang University, for example, about the topics and content that would be taught by the university students?\n\nThe course instructors asked the opinions of the school partners about the following four themes: interesting science, health promotion, personal development, interesting daily English and their expectations on the theme-related contents and their corresponding proportions, and then made revisions accordingly. After reviewing the service plan, the school partners accepted and recognized the concept of service-learning, and expressed confidence in the enthusiasm and attitude of the university students. Through this active communication, the school partners felt being respected. With a good understanding of the service details and with their opinions being addressed, the partners would be more willing to cooperate.\n\nDuring the service period, the collaborating parties had to handle conflicts and keep maintaining a good understanding of each other. The PolyU hoped that the university students could play a leading role in class management. At the beginning, the head teachers worried that the university students could not manage the class effectively, so they often entered the classrooms to intervene the class activities and to discipline the school children. It was found that whenever the head teachers appeared, the school children would follow directly the instructions of them, and the performance of university students was hence restricted. During the learning process, the head teachers thought that the class was too messy while the university students regarded that the head teachers were too strict.\n\nTo enhance mutual understanding, the course instructors of PolyU invited the head teachers to participate in the reflective meeting every afternoon to share their observations and concerns. The university students would also explain to the head teachers their interactive teaching methods and their views on the noisy class. Gradually, with more understanding, the head teachers finally intervened less in the following year. During the preparation stage, the course instructors also guided the university students to understand the cultural differences between the two places and expected them to try their best to seek the help of the head teachers so that their service activities could be completed at the scheduled service period.\n\nAt the beginning of the third year, the collaboration became smooth. The head teachers finally showed their confidence in the university students and they did not observe the class teaching daily. Instead, they would meet the university students first to introduce the class information as well as the characteristics of the primary school students. The university students could also easily make contact with them in their office in case of need. There would be regular reflective meetings at the end of the service day. The collaboration model between the two parties was finally well established after this active communication and mutual adjustment process.\n\nWhen the service period of the year ended, the PolyU and the service partners in China maintained their contacts with each other through different means.\n\n<b><i>Sharing students’ learning outcomes.</i></b> The primary school invited a local TV station to film a graduation ceremony at the end of the service period and had it broadcasted as news. The school shared the information with the course instructors of PolyU and the information could be used in teaching in the coming year. The PolyU also shared with the school the videos and photos taken during the service period, which were about progress and outcomes of the teaching activities as well as the reflective meetings.\n\n<b><i>Invitation to conference.</i></b> When a paper, based on the data collected for this service-learning course in the first year of collaboration, was written by the course instructors of the PolyU and was accepted for presentation at a conference, the service partners were also invited to attend the conference. This helped to improve mutual understanding and contact between them.\n\n<b><i>Establish personal relationship.</i></b> At the same time, some personal relationships were also developed and they would update each other. A trusting collaborating relationship was gradually established and sustained among the service partners."

            text:
              "In the first year, about 40 students from the PolyU participated in the Children course. Two course instructors jointly led the university students to Hangzhou. As a result, with the positive learning experiences and outcomes of students, the primary school expected that the PolyU would continue to provide service activities in the second year and was willing to develop a long-term cooperative partnership. Therefore, the PolyU organized two classes with about 80 students in the following year. In addition, there were two more course instructors and one project assistant. Finally, a total of 5 colleagues (4 course instructors and 1 project assistant) led about 80 university students to Hangzhou. The four course instructors provided guidance to the university students while the project assistant was responsible for handling administrative matters. The university students formed teams of 4 and 5 students each and each team would serve about twenty primary school students. The number of primary school students in the school also increased from around 200 in the first year to around 400.\n\nThe increase of the class size brought new challenges to the collaborating parties. The primary school required more support, for example, in handling meals and maintaining the hygiene conditions. At the same time, there were problems to resolve. When the primary school students faced problems, they would normally approach the school principal or head teachers for help instead of discussing with the university students there in the class first. For example, for late delivery of lunch boxes to a class while the students from other classes had already started eating, some school students would cry and go to find the principal directly.\n\nThe increase in class size also caused more accidents. The course instructors also encountered problems. On one occasion, one of them had an urgent health issue and had to go back to Hong Kong early. The course instructors had to deal with the manpower allocation among them timely at that time. Thereafter, the class size was maintained to be 80 and in two large classes. The two large classes formed 4 small groups of 20 students each. This 20 students’ group size was more suitable for a course instructor to observe and supervise."

          "At the time of design, the course instructor of Children paid close attention to the students’ opportunities to apply their knowledge acquired during lessons in the service activities arranged for the service targets. If the two (curriculum and services) are out of touch of each other, the students would think that the previous learning in lessons was useless and the service activities were no different from ordinary volunteer activities.\n\nTo enhance the linkage between the curriculum and the services, the course instructors would introduce the characteristics of children and adolescents at their different stages of development in the spring semester. Students would also have the opportunity to develop appropriate teaching topics for the group’s teaching plan with the background theories they acquired during the lessons. For example, when the university students obtained the knowledge from the lectures that the children of middle childhood would be prone to accidents and in the choice of “health promotion” as the theme, the university students specifically chose the ‘Furniture Safety’ as the teaching topic so as to help school children to better protect themselves at home.\n\nAnother objective of the course is to develop students' teamwork abilities. Therefore, in the service activities, the university students formed into different groups, and each group would lead the service activities for 20 primary school students. There would be a team leader each time with the support of other student members of the team in guiding the children to participate in discussions and activities and in this regard, it was expected to enhance the university students’ abilities in teamwork, collaboration and communication.\n\nIn addition to the design phase, after the end of daily service activities, the course instructors also attached great importance to how to connect with the course content when leading reflection and discussion. The university students would be guided to respect the individual differences and diversity of children. In their practical teaching process, the students often encountered the different learning performances of children. For example, when learning English, some primary school children showed a high standard, but some only reached the entry level. The course instructors would provide specific advice on how to design tiered learning tasks and different levels of worksheet based on students’ abilities, and provide students with different scaffolding. At the same time, the instructors guided university students to understand the individual differences and diversity in the growth of children and adolescents and to take care of the diversity of children in the course of service activities."

During the service time, the university students would encounter primary school children who needed special care. Therefore, when meeting the head teachers, the university students would emphasize the understanding of those children who needed special attention and how to deal with them\n\nIn addition to the understanding of the characteristics of the students before the start of the formal service activities, the course instructors also paid great attention to analyzing the characteristics and behaviors of the school students together with the university students in the daily reflective activities, especially about the school students who acted with rebellious behaviors, they would explore the causes of such behaviors, how their negative emotions were generated, and so on. This was very helpful for university students to deepen their understanding of the characteristics of primary school students."

With direct interactions with the school children, the university students were expected to develop their passion of caring towards the children and showed their empathy. For example, a girl in Dr. Yu’s class transformed herself from a girl who disliked children to one who would like to help them. She later joined a tour to Africa to help more children. She found that children were sincere though sometimes annoying."

For example, the course instructors had designed for lecture themes on interesting science, health promotion, personal development and interesting daily English. The university students could select their teaching topics from the four themes based on their own experiences and interests. The instructors would encourage students to select those themes related to their major study. For example, students whose major was in marketing and finance could choose to teach the primary school children how to manage their pocket money. Meanwhile, the instructors would organize workshops and helped the students to equip with teaching skills, such as how to engage primary school students in activities and how to improve their learning motivation.\n\nThe university students would also discuss with the instructors their lesson plans. With the guidance of the instructors, the students would adjust their teaching plans taking into consideration the development level of the primary school students and the different learning context of Mainland China.\n\nAfter the completion of writing a teaching plan, the university students would discuss with the instructors how much the plan was suitable for the development level of the primary school students and whether the content was suitable for presentation in the context of the Mainland China. For example, the Children class will cover knowledge about physical development. Based on the learning need of the upper primary school students, the university students plan to explore topics about sex education. The instructors then explained to the university students about the social background of Mainland China, the general views of people on sex education, and suggested the extent that it could be talked about. With the feedback from the instructors, the students would revise their teaching plans. In this process, the instructors would provide guidance only and would not revise the lesson plans for the students directly"

Before the service activities, the instructors will introduce the theories and the students will have self-reflections on their personal growth experience. In the workshops, the instructors will guide students to apply skills acquired in lessons in classroom management as well as drawing the attention of participants in class. The instructors will present specific situations and questions and help students to learn through case study in which the students discuss for solutions to problematic situations. The instructors observe that after continuous reflection activities, students would use what they have learned to analyze problems and reflect on their personal learning in the process of offering service.\n\nDuring the service activities in Hangzhou, the course instructors, students from PolyU and Zhejiang University participated in reflection meetings at the end of daily activities, and the primary school teachers would sometimes participate. The students were more willing to share true feelings and reflect on themselves in a learning environment where there were sincere expression, mutual trust, supportive and safe atmosphere. Each student would talk about their teaching process in class and reflect on their own performance and difficulties at the service activities. They also shared how to get along with the children. In addition to the positive learning, all parties involved would also share their weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n\nIn the reflection meetings, the research students from Zhejiang University acted as observers and they would share what they had seen at the teaching sessions. With reference to how the university students took care of different physical and psychological needs of the school children, the course instructors designed a classroom observation sheet. Prior to taking up their observation role, they would be required to attend a workshop on how to use the observations sheet, about the principles of recording, and about how to give positive encouragement and constructive opinions when making comments on students’ performance. Although the results would not be taken into account as assessment scores, the use of observation sheet can help students structure their observation content, follow the proper observation principles, give helpful opinions and suggestions during the reflection meeting. The course instructors find that the comments are very helpful for the improvement in the teaching process and therefore, accordingly, students can usually make timely adjustment in the coming service sessions.\n\nTo overcome the challenges and difficulties raised by the students and the observers, the instructors would provide timely feedback and suggestions, for example, on how to talk with and get along with the children. For problems which cannot be resolved immediately, the students will be provided with some principles to understand the problems at that time. When some individual students have emotional issue, the instructors would follow up and offer personal support. For example, the PolyU students pointed out the variations in the educational methods between Mainland China and Hong Kong as teachers in China put emphasis on students’ disciplines in class and had strict rules. Accordingly, the PolyU students would express their views and discuss how to use interactive methods during the lessons."

              "Service-learning is different from traditional teaching. This requires the instructor to recognize the concept of service-learning and to believe that it can have a positive impact on students’ learning. It also requires the instructor to have a concrete and thorough understanding of the characteristics of service-learning. In addition, the subject instructors also need to invest more time and energy to deal with matters related to other stakeholders, for example, students and other service partners. The course instructors also need to provide students additional guidance to the design and running of service plans with the service partners and recipients. Therefore, the course instructors also need to spend time on understanding thoroughly the expectations and needs of the service partners.\n\nFor Children course, at the preparation stage prior to the service activities, the course instructors provided guidance and support to students, which included the guidance about the design of the teaching plans. For example, the course instructors would advise to adjust the level of content difficulty when it was found that the primary school students might find it hard to understand. The course instructors would also advise whether the selected topic was suitable for Mainland students, and would give suggestions how the university students could revise the plan according to the background and context of the primary school. For example, a group of students designed topics related to sex education. The course instructors would explain the differences between the mainland and Hong Kong regarding the physical health and sex education for primary school students, and would advise the university students how to revise the teaching plans and methods. With reference to the instructor's opinions, the students revised their teaching plans.\n\nFor another example, the Children course focused on promoting positive youth development. Understanding and respecting the diversity of students is one of the important principles. In the process of instructing university students to design teaching plans and in their teaching practice, the course instructors paid much attention to guiding university students to take care of the diversity of students. If some students did not keep up with the progress, the instructors would make specific suggestions on how to set up layered content and coursework. In the implementation process, the diversity of school children was also taken into consideration, and different kinds of support and help would be provided to the children with respect to their differences in their participation in activities.\n\nWhen the service activities formally begin, the university students will encounter some unforeseen challenges and their emotions will fluctuate. The course instructors would pay great attention to provide emotional support to students. They would observe the performance and improvement of university students in their attitudes, engagement levels, and caring of students. The instructors would recognize the strengths of students and proposed improvement suggestions. The instructors observed that when university students were positively encouraged, they were often more willing to take the initiative to improve the teaching plans and considered multiple strategies to improve the learning effectiveness of primary school students. For example, on the first day of teaching, usually everyone was frustrated. The instructor would focus on giving emotional support to university students, telling them that the performance on the first day was not the most important. The instructors was more concerned with the time and energy the university students had put in the whole service, their attitude towards service activities, their caring of the primary school students, and the improvement of the university students in the process. The instructors recognized the strengths of the university students and pointed out their areas for improvement. This encouraged the university students to be willing to take the initiative to change themselves, revise their plans, and consider using various strategies to get along with the primary school students.\n\nIn addition, for service activities to be conducted well, it depends very much on good a collaborative relationship between the university and the community. The performance of university students in service activities has become a critical factor for the establishment of this relationship and therefore, the instructors will pay more attention to the performance of university students. As a compulsory course for all undergraduate students, the participating students’ are having diverse backgrounds and learning motives. For example, some university students were less participative at the beginning of the course and they just wanted to meet basic course requirements. With regard to past experience, when university students were in direct contact with primary school students, they often changed their views on service activities. Therefore, the course instructors would be attentive in provision of timely and relevant guidance to guide students to understand the meaning and functions of service activities. The good news is that the learning motives of university students will often be positively cultivated in this service-learning process."

In addition, the course instructors would also invite the principal of the primary school and the head teachers of each class to fill out a questionnaire to evaluate the performance of the students from the PolyU.\n\nIn addition to the questionnaire, the course instructors will review the effectiveness of the entire service activity with the principal and all the head teachers after each service event. According to the opinions of the principal and the teachers, the instructors will make adjustments in the teaching arrangements for the next year. For example, in the first year, a head teacher in charge of a class mentioned about health issues which would pose a safety hazard. Therefore, in the workshops held in the next year, the instructors increased the sanitation treatment in the class management, prompting the university students how to arrange student-on-duty daily and how to check the doors and windows. After making the corresponding adjustments, the primary school teachers felt very satisfied in the next year.\n\nThe course instructors also received feedback from other research projects. For example, another research team at the PolyU also visited the school of the Children course. Colleagues from the research team shared the results with the course instructors. The research team mentioned that some students mentioned that the 5-day service activities were always carried out in the school. It becomes a little bit boring, and the university students lack both the understanding of local culture and the opportunity of cultural exchange with local people. The course instructors listened to the opinion and made adjustments in the service arrangement for the next year, making 4 days as teaching days and 1 day as cultural day. In the morning of the cultural day, the university students of led the primary school students to visit a museum near the school, and they shared several topics in the afternoon, for example, the impressive things in the exhibition in the museum. The primary school students introduced the things that represent Hangzhou culture. The university students introduced the culture of their hometown. Both the students from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Zhejiang University students shared something about the cultures of their hometown. The primary school students brought something from home and explained it with their personal stories. This sharing activity allowed students of the PolyU to gain a rich understanding of primary school students and local culture within a short period of time."

          "It is a compulsory requirement for every student of the PolyU to complete a service-learning course which carries 3 credits. Although the students can have different choices, for those students with low interest in service-learning, their motivation and service performance will be unsatisfactory. From the experience of the course instructors, if the instructor can help some of these students to be properly prepared, give appropriate guidance in the process of learning and service, the students will learn and make a change. However, there are also some students who are more difficult to change. They always regard the service as an activity that they are forced to complete. They would only invest the least time and effort into it and it is difficult for teachers and students to communicate in depth.\n\nThe two-semester course schedule also has certain limitations too. Since some of the theories are taught in the spring semester, some of the content has been forgotten when students start to participate in the workshop during the summer. Therefore, some students suggest the arrangement of all the content to be taught before the summer semester."

            text: "Since 2008-2009, Dr. Law had been teaching the course called Art and Well Being (thereafter called Art). At the beginning, she strongly believed that experiential learning was crucial for students because the objective of the course was to discuss the influence of art on individuals or a group. She believed that if students could change others or even the whole community through the creation of art, such experience would certainly facilitate their deeper understanding of relevant theories. However, in the first year, Dr. Law was not familiar with the concept and practice of service-learning. She had no clear ideas of which organizations she could cooperate with and how the cooperation should be. Therefore, she kept adopting classroom teaching methods in class. During the first year of the course, Dr. Law began to communicate with colleagues from the Office of Service-Learning (OSL) at Lingnan University and learned the cooperation strategies with institutions and service-learning teaching practices.\n\nIn academic year 2009-2010, She attempted to incorporate the elements of service-learning into the Art course. 20 students took the course and among them, 8 students participated in service-learning activities. These students were divided into two teams, with four students each team, who provided service for mentally disabled adults and the South Asian children. She only arranged some students (8 out of 20) to participate in the service-learning activities because she would like to closely follow up the progress of the service-learning activities and to ensure the quality of the service. Since only some students participated in service-learning, these students did not need to join the school’s tutorial classes. Therefore, she made some adjustments to the course contents. For example, instead of teaching some concepts and theories in tutorials, she did it in lectures so that all the students could learn the key concepts. Since then, the number of students, who participated in service-learning activities, had been maintained between 4 and 10 each year. Although Dr. Law had attempted to require all 20 students to join the service-learning activities at one academic year since there were no other choices for the activities, she was very concerned that this “compulsory” requirement would affect students’ willingness and commitment of participation in service-learning.\n\nAt the first year (2009), students reported fruitful learning outcomes and that led Dr. Law to recognize the value of service-learning. Service-learning emphasizes mutual benefits and it can become a platform for inter-professional sharing. More importantly, Dr. Law finds that service- learning can help participating students to have changes. Through the students’ experience and reflective reports, she realized that the students had understood the expression power and good communication means of art. Some students had improved their social awareness and civic responsibilities during the process of helping a specific community group. They were not only concerned about their own affairs, but also cared more about the society and the community. Some students had changed their attitudes towards family members and ways of getting along with them. Moreover, their stereotypes towards social minorities had also been reduced. For instance, some students stated that they would pay more attention to the South Asians who passed by, imagining that the South Asians were born in Hong Kong and they were also willing to learn and respect their customs.\n\n\t“After checking students’ reflection and feedback, I have been totally committed.”\n\t“The feedback collected from the two groups of students has made me very touched and taught me what service-learning is.”\n\nSeveral years after, Dr. Law saw the long-term impact of this course on students’ career development. About 10% of the students who had taken the course had been involved in (or planned to) working for NGOs after graduation. Some of them worked as professional art clinicians. One student worked as a program manager in a nursing home. He called the nursing home an art home so as to enhance the life quality of the elderly. Other students also shared that they were inspired by the experience from service-learning and would like to have its applications in the future."

            header: "The course brief",
            text: "Referring to the course outline, the course Art “is designed to provide students with an introduction to the healing power of art. The concept of communicating personal ideas through art and of achieving a sense of well-being through artistic creation is not new, but the study and practice of using art and art-making as a form of healing have emerged only recently. Cross referencing findings of advanced modern sciences, theories of art and anthropology, the course investigates how artistic creation and general engagement with art can help people to gain an awareness of themselves and others, as well as to cope with symptoms, stress, and traumatic experiences. A Service Learning Research Scheme is incorporated if relevant services are available.”\n\nIn the classroom teaching, Dr. Law’s lecture included a few topics as follows: “Biological nature of art making; Art, sciences and the visual, Art and memory, Art and well-being, History of using art as therapy, Art and psychoanalysis, Art and education, Art and Symbols, Art therapy and art facilitation.”\n\nTo well prepare students for their learning in the service-based activities, Dr. Law believes that it is helpful to set up workshops or sharing sessions with alumni for university students to understand service-learning more before the service activities. These include:\n\n\t- Service learning is not just about giving to others, but learning to gain and enjoy in the process.\n\t- Students can eliminate common misunderstandings about service-learning, which are about that service-learning is equivalent to volunteering or students would have the sense of superiority in the service process.\n\t- Those non-voluntary students in participating in the service activities can then recognize the unique learning experiences from service-learning.\n\t- Students should also plan for their future activities based on their expertise.\n\nThe pre-service training is also helpful for students to have psychological preparation and to understand the importance of devoting love in service activities. Apart from the preparatory activities arranged by Dr. Law and the art facilitator, the OSL of LU also provides lectures and consultations to help students understand the meaning of service-learning.\n\nIn addition, during the design and preparation of the service activities, Dr. Law would prompt students to prepare alternative plans to deal with possible emergencies. For instance, for students who provided service for the South Asian children, their first workshop was for the 10-year-old children, but it turned out that there were three more kindergarten children who participated. The actual number of participants might also be uncertain. For instance, there might be 20 participants this time, but the number of participants might be reduced to 3 the next time. After the first workshop, the university students would prepare 2 plans according to the situation they could realize. For example, if both older and younger children showed up, university students would put a large piece of paper on the table and the children could stand around the table. The university students would tell the children that each person had to create a painting related to the theme of jungle within their own capabilities. Children painted anything and university students did not need to correct them but they came to understand this group of children that some liked McDonald’s while others liked whales."

      partnership: {
        content: "Dr. Law knew more about the potential organizations to cooperate with through the OSL at Lingnan University and with the assistance of the colleagues in the office, she began to work with two organizations. Since then, she would communicate with the collaborating partners prior to planning for the service-learning activities. She also tried to meet the colleagues from the OSL to explore the possible cooperation with other suitable organizations.\n\nDr. Law would invite art facilitators to go to the organizations with her. The art facilitators were employed by Dr. Law for facilitating the learning of the students and they would provide guidance and support to the students during the service-learning activities. When meeting the partners of the organizations, both parties would share their expectations, the types of service activities that could be provided by the university students, and also about the characteristics of the service recipients. For instance, a centre in Tung Chung provided service for immigrants. The centre related the difficulty of the new immigrants in integration into the Hong Kong society due to their narrow scope of activities and certain discrimination from Hong Kong people. The centre expected university students to provide help to tackle this social issue. This group of university students then put more emphasis on facilitating new immigrants to express their emotions and life situation through a variety of art forms.\n\nAfter running the similar service activities for a period of time, Dr. Law then considered how to sustain and deepen this collaborating relationships. However, during the communication with the organization, there involved some uncertain factors, such as the change of the person- in-charge of the organization. For considering a long-term cooperation, like 3 years, of a project, the objectives of both collaborating parties could be different. It would not be only talking about the number of workshops to be provided for the service recipients, but to look for how they could have substantial change in the long run. This requires further and thorough communication with collaborating partners.\n\nWhen the Art course has been run for several years, the OSL understands more the characteristics of the curriculum and the service requirements of the course. When there are suitable organizations and service needs, they will actively contact Dr. Law to develop more diverse service activities. For example, a colleague from the OSL introduced Art course and its service activities to an organization which is providing service to teenagers. When university students completed the service activities, they were very impressed. When they met the younger teenagers who had gone astray, there was great impact on them. The students have enhanced their empathy and also their gratitude for their families as well as the school resources they have now. \n\n\t“Inter-professional sharing is often carried out during the cooperation with organizations. Both parties can benefit from it and everyone respects each other.”"

        content: "In the academic year 2019/2020, Dr. Law cooperated with the first two institutions which provided service for the disabled and the South Asian youth. For choosing the service recipients, she mainly considered the extent to which characteristics of the people being served matched with the content of the course. That is, after the completion of the service-learning process, the students should realize that they had applied the theory and knowledge learned to the real-life and this allowed them to understand the meaning of the theory.\n\nShe explained that the choice of serving the mentally disabled people was due to the fact that there was little knowledge of how to communicate with them in daily life. One of the learning points of the course is taking art as a platform for promoting communication and expression. Once you expressed and communicated, you got connected. For the choice of South Asian children as service recipients, it is because they do not understand English and Cantonese well enough to study and live in Hong Kong. Using art as a second language and universal language is another learning point in this course. She believes that art-related discipline itself is suitable for combining certain service activities because art is a good platform. Through art-related activities, participants will be delightful. Learning is also playing. During the process of playing, children and university students will establish close relationships, love and connect with each other."

      service: {
        content: "Through service activities, Dr. Law expected that students could understand how the course led individuals to appreciate and be thankful. Art is a platform to help people express themselves, communicate and connect with others. Most of the service activities arranged by Dr. Law were for the disabled, South Asians, and new immigrants. Direct connection with these people will allow students to realize the power of art. It is relatively difficult to communicate with the dementia, autistic and intellectual disabled people, but through face-to- face interaction, students’ overall perception of these people will change.\n\nFor instance, one student who did not engage in all aspects of the course at the beginning, reported a fruitful learning outcome after experiencing unique service activities. The group that this student joined was providing service to a group of severely disabled people who had been living in the hospital. These people had been in wheelchairs for a long time and many of them were unable to use language to express themselves. So there was a piece of paper in front of their chairs stating water, rice, toilet, clothes, cold or not and they could point to the words wherever they wanted to go. Their disability situation was severe to such degree. When university students met these intellectual disabled people, they realized that the originally planned activities could not be carried out. Group activities had been forced to change into one- to-one activities. During this process, the university students were touched by the impact of the same-age mentally handicapped people whom they took care of. It was hard for university students to imagine that some people had been in bed and wheelchair since birth. In the course of the service activities, a mentally handicapped girl was also touched and cried when completing the artistic activities with the university students. This was also because they were connected with each other and emotionally touched. Such emotional connection had also moved the university student. The student began to cherish what he had in his life, and therefore he treated his life and study seriously and considered studying psychology.\n\nWhen the recipients connected with them, the university students were also touched. For example, the service recipients would show reluctance when seeing the university students leave. Some people would ask, “You are not coming back? Please come back!” These simple and sincere expressions were very touching to university students. Some students stated that if they had time in the future, they would continue to be volunteers. Such service experience also allows university students to eliminate stereotypes of people with intellectual disabilities, and are thus willing to actively interact with them. University students can see the positive characteristics of people with intellectual disabilities. For example, although they have limited IQ, they are kind and do not deceive people. They would also like to express emotions directly, such as telling you whether they are happy or not. These are things that could not be taught in class and they are the reasons why Dr. Law insists on integrating service-learning.\n\nA student who provided service to some South Asian children mentioned that during the ice- breaking phase, university students played “passing the music boxes” with them. The rule of the game was that whoever had the music box had to tell where he was from. When the music box was passed to a university student, he said, “I am from Dongguan.” A Pakistani teenager asked, “Are you not born in Hong Kong?” This teenager realized that these university students were not Hong Kong local people. The idea that “we are not Hong Kong local people” resonated with these Pakistani teenagers and they began to share province in Pakistan they came from. University students realized that having a closer relationship with the South Asian people could help them integrate into the Hong Kong society. They also realized that the South Asians were not marginal ethnic minorities and many yellow-skinned locals also came from other countries.\n\n\t“I saw a lot of transformation, so this is why I devote in service-learning. I think these are things that students cannot get in the classroom. If they do not experience by themselves, they could not have deep understanding.”\n\nIn Art course, students designed and implemented art activities as a group. This arrangement allowed them to learn how to cooperate with each other and flexibly handle emergencies in service. The service recipients and the activities themselves also provided opportunities for university students to take on some specific tasks. For example, in the process of implementing workshops for the South Asian children, some South Asian children appeared to be overactive, or suddenly had aggressive behaviors or walked around back and forth. The university students quickly learned that there was a need for team members to communicate and deal with children alone. This experience made university students realize the importance of cooperation in the implementation of workshop activities. Although each person has a different role, these roles have to be reassigned any time when accidence occurs. The university students can learn the importance and pleasure of cooperation from such experience and some can gradually become good friends."

      reflection: {
        content: "In Art course, students who joined the service-learning were required to complete 6 to 8 service activities. Each activities lasted for 1 to 2 hours. After completing 2 to 3 times of the service activities, students had to return to the university to patriciate in group consultation to share the current status and problems of the service activities. Dr. Law focused on guiding students to think and link the service experience with the subject knowledge. She mentioned that it was very important to arrange consultation section at this time. Some students thought that service was to do volunteer work. Although they wrote down proposals, and there was also an artist to provide guidance, many students, after going to the field, were very confused that they did not know what they wanted or the plan was not feasible and they did not know how to follow up and handle it.\n\nAfter starting the service activity, students had to record what they had seen and their experience. For example, when students observed that a child was very naughty, they had to explain the naughty behaviors and language performance, such as kicking someone, swearing or crying after kicking someone. Before the implementation of the workshop, university students had to write an activity proposal. They had to carefully observe the service process. Within 15 minutes after the end of the daily activity, they had to have a one-the-spot record and reflection. When going for consultation, university students should consult Dr. Law with these contents.\n\nThe consulting activities should help students understand the meaning of the service and learning. Most students, after talking to the teachers, started to understand what they were doing and they should do. For instance, some students tried to do art work but the service recipients did not respond or rarely participated, so the university students did not know how to deal with it. Dr. Law started from what the students did by asking students to think about what they really wanted to do and guided them to think about the differences between art and language. Art is visual language and it is about senses, instead of structural language. She further guided university students to understand how specific activities in the service could reflect art as a visual language to express senses and feelings. Then students began to focus on senses in the service activities. For example, they recorded a variety of voices, like birds singing, fireworks, etc. After listening to these sounds, the South Asians or the disabled needed to draw according to what they heard. During this process, it is important for the instructor to participate in the consulting activities because he/she is the person who is very familiar with the subject knowledge. This also requires instructors to invest in a lot of time and energy. For another example, a group of university students designed eight creative workshops for South Asian students in Sham Shui Po one year. At the first consultation, the students mentioned that he had not thought that some part of Hong Kong was very poor. Accordingly, students encountered a lot of challenges. For example, there was a situation that a sister wanted to bring her younger brother to join an activity. The students designed an activity for a 10-year-old child, but she brought along a 3-year-old brother. This became a challenge about how to arrange the activity for both a 10-year-old and a 3-year-old children at the same time. Additionally, because the classroom provided by the cooperative NGO was very small and the South Asian children were very excited. Moreover, some part of this room were in renovation, the artist was very concerned about the safety of the children. As the problem of the small space could not be solved, and the children became more and more active, changing the contents of the workshop was not feasible to solve the problem. Finally, after the end of the fourth course, the artist decided to cancel the remaining four workshops. The university students who participated in the service activities were very frustrated with this outcome and thought that their efforts were wasted. Dr. Law tried to guide students to learn from failure. Failure was also a kind of learning and she led students to think more about what had been learned in the process of designing and implementing four workshops.\n\nAnother example was related to the service activities for the South Asian children. In the discussion with the NGO, the NGO proposed to leave half an hour each time for themselves to arrange some specific activities. During the service activities, students found out that this half an hour was left for the South Asian children to complete the task of copying the Chinese characters. This had been in conflict with the principles designed by the university students of being spontaneous, joyful and self-directed. The South Asian children were not very interested in writing and even drew randomly. Dr. Law would advise students to have direct communication with the social workers in the institution and try to understand the purpose and objectives of this assignment. Dr. Law also asked university students to consider whether they were willing to teach the South Asian children to learn Chinese. She further gave specific suggestions, such as starting from the characteristics of the Chinese characters, their hieroglyphs and the phonographic structures, so as to help the South Asian children understand Chinese characters faster. If university students communicated with the social worker with sharing attitudes, they might obtain twice the result. As a result, after the communication, the social workers agreed that the university students could teach the next time. At the next-time activity, students were playing hieroglyphics for half an hour and they were very happy.\n\nDr. Law believes that maintaining flexibility during guidance has to make students realize that the key to the service is to understand the needs of the service recipients, rather than what the students think they can give or do for the service recipients. Therefore, students should listen to the needs and requirement of the service recipients and the service activities should meet their needs in certain aspects."

In the first time of service-learning, the students had to complete\n\n\t- 1 oral presentation by the group (other students needed to complete 2 times)\n\t- 1 reflection essay (other students did not need to do)\n\t- Final papers and examination (other students had the same requirement)\n\nSince students from the service-learning group reflected about the large amount of homework, Dr. Law revised the evaluation requirements in the following year. Students in the service- learning group could combine their final papers with the reflection essay. The articles must have references and relevant theories cited. Dr. Law explained that the reflective essay only required students to describe the status and reflection of the service activities, while the final paper was an academic paper, which had to include academic literature reference, analysis and discussion of relevant theories within the subject.\n\nThis was a course with three credits. Students were not just completing the service activities, but also needed to link theory with service activities so as to validate the theory and have deeper understanding of the social issues within the service activities. In fact, students accepted this requirement because this allowed students to have the opportunities to apply the theory learned in the classroom to explain the problems and phenomena encountered in service activities. Dr. Law observed that individual students who performed better in the service attempted to challenge the academic literature that they read. When students had specific experience, it was relatively easy for them to turn such experience into words."

            text: "Art facilitators mainly provided advice related to the status of the service at consultation and presentation and also provided feedback on students’ performance. Because the art facilitators would complete the service activities with the students at each course, the observation and evaluation from the art facilitor were very important. The art facilitfors would write down the observation and evaluations of each student in the service activities as references for Dr. Law’s assessment. The art facilitor did not simply give scores based on the evaluations, but had also needed to provide examples to justify the suggested scores.\n\nWhen students had group presentation, Dr. Law would also invite the colleagues form the organization to come and give advice on students’ performance and the issues discussed in the report. If time was permitted, she also hoped to receive the written records from the organization and their evaluation. The whole process also promoted mutual understanding between the organization and the students. For example, social workers were concerned about safety issues because university students had designed too many activities for children with hyperactivity whereas university students believed that it would be difficult to stimulate children’s inner self in a quiet state. In group presentation, university students had the opportunity to explain the rationales of the activities, and the social workers of the organization could also have the opportunity to express their concerns and also to explain reasons behind these concerns. As a result, the group presentation had been turned from an assessment and sharing section to an opportunity for dialogues for different parties.\n\nFrom teacher’s point of view, Dr. Law believes that providing feedback to students also needs flexibility. For instance, when listening to students’ demands, understanding their frustration and their observations, teachers should judge whether students’ observations are at the right direction according to each person’s situation, judge whether their complaints are reasonable, understand the emotions students experience during service and help them alleviate their negative emotions. Therefore, listening is equally important to teachers. Although teachers can prepare questions and points in advance, in the process of consultation and feedback, teachers should provide specific suggestions according to each students’ specific problems and difficulties. Dr. Law would keep asking students three questions: what is the goal of this workshop, what are you doing now and what your biggest problem is."

The facilitators would give advice and suggestions on service proposals prepared by students. Prior to commencement of the service activities, they would go to the community centre to understand the specific characteristics of the service recipients and to propose training and preparation required for the university students. For instance, introducing service recipients with intellectual disabilities who had symptoms of obsessive- compulsive disorder; helping university students to understand why they had these behaviors, and how to handle them, and as such, it was expected that university students’ tension and fear due to the lack of understanding could be alleviated. The role of facilitators was to motivate and inspire university students, rather than replacing university students to implement proposals or finish art workshops.\n\nThe art facilitator also worked with Dr. Law to communicate with the partner institution to understand its needs and the characteristics of the service recipients. The art facilitator would then understand when and how to provide students’ support, and how to help them understand the course, the expectation and requirements of the service. For example, university students might not be aware that their inadvertent speech might have brought discrimination against certain groups. Therefore, the art facilitator would help improve university students’ cross- cultural sensitivity and how to avoid harming others during communication.

For instance, there was an elderly, who was talking to a student, mentioned that all of her relatives had passed away and she was alone. She started crying. The students did not know how to handle in that situation at that moment. After the service time, the students contacted Dr. Law immediately. Dr. Law proposed the following handling approach:\n\n\t- Understand how the students handled the situation first.\n\t-Then she would lead students to think and reflect, such as why the elderly would burst into tears suddenly. With whom she would cry or not during interaction and why. Dr. Law thought that art was about feeling and there might be things in the activities that triggered the elderly’s deep emotions. When encountering such situation, Dr. Law provided guidance on handling, for example, should not let the student leave the centre with negative emotions.\n\t- Dr. Law then guided the students to identify solutions. She asked students to let the elderly describe her feelings and experiences, and then choose colors that could represent her feelings so as to help her release her negative emotions. When the elderly calmed down, she could be led to draw a picture to express the current situation.\n\t- After the communication with students, Dr. Law also called the social worker and informed him about the incident. She advised the social worker to pay more attention to the emotions of the elderly.\n\nDr. Law also coordinated and facilitated between the university students and the art facilitator. For instance, the expectation of the art facilitator for the student team who served the South Asian children was very high that he asked university students to modify their service proposals four times back and forth. The university students made revisions accordingly, but they did not understand the reasons for such repeated revisions. They even thought that the facilitator was too picky. When Dr. Law knew this specific situation, she found that the facilitator was asking the university students to pay more attention to the details of the service proposals, such as the size of the scissors and the type of the adhesive tape. She then explained to the students the reasons for considering the use of specific materials, the importance of developing the habits of being precise, and ways to understand and deal with different types of work and requirements. When university students realized the facilitator’s positive intention, the meticulous way of working and caring for students, they started to show appreciation for the facilitator’s character and serious attitude. Gradually, they became friends. Those were things that Dr. Law could not teach in class and that was a good learning experience for students."

For instance, students did not like painting and sometimes they did not know how to chat with the service recipients. They did not know how to arrange the activities for two hours at the service site. Dr. Law would emphasize that the focus of the service activities was not teaching new immigrants how to paint, but to help tem express their feelings and difficulties in life through the use of art. She would also advise other students to arrange activities that were easy to handle, such as manual work, hand-making beading, etc.\n\nHowever, Dr. Law believed that the main problem was whether students were interested in participating in the service activities. In this regard, she explained to students about the meaning of the service activities and asked students to contact the new immigrants to understand them more. She also encouraged students to get to know the new immigrants’ notions through art. For instance, many new immigrants linked their hometowns with the expression of artistic activities. They would come to know that their hearts were connected with their hometowns, especially among women and teenagers. It could be seen that some students were very touched and they made a change later.\n\nNevertheless, students’ motivation to learn is still a challenge that Dr. Law faces from time to time."

        content: "Case 3 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled “Motor Learning and Development” (Hereinafter referred to as Motor). This course was offered by Prof. Cheung Siu Yin, she is from Hong Kong Baptist University.\n\nProfessor Cheung has been teaching service learning for more than 10 years. The idea of teaching service learning came after attending a service learning workshop organized by a business school and when Professor Cheung began to understand the concept of service learning as well as how to provide new learning opportunities for students. Furthermore, she herself has been involved in many services and volunteer activities since childhood, thereby leading to a deep understanding of how to help people grow and change their perspectives through service learning.\n\nAt the initial stage, students who took the Motor Learning and Development course were from year three and year four levels at the university. There were about 30 students each class. The course was in the spring (second) semester of each academic year. For the first 6 years or so, Professor Cheung mainly worked with a kindergarten in Tai Po and a nearby elderly center. University students, thus, had the opportunities to compare the muscle development of both children and the elderly. Later, the curriculum was changed. Students who took the course were mainly freshmen and sophomores and the course started in the fall (first) semester. Such changes could not match with the timetable of the kindergarten and therefore, only the service activities of the elderly center were retained. The number of students enrolled in this course had increased to about 60. Students’ reflections and homework also focused on the physical fitness of the elderly."

Both parties, the hosting university and the service receiving institutions should discuss regularly how to benefit the service recipients and students so as to achieve a win-win situation. After many years’ cooperation with the elderly centre, the overall feedback was very good. The elderly all called Professor Cheung as Miss Cheung and with a good relationship established with the elderly, Professor Cheung felt very happy.\n\nIn the process of developing cooperative relations, an equal status had been fully reflected between the university students and the elderly, which benefited both parties. For the elderly, students from the Physical Education Department were very energetic that they led the elder people to exercise their limbs and taught them some motor skills. In the last part of the service, the elder people often came out to teach university students what they were good at. For example, a 90-year-old taught students Tai Chi, and the university students also appreciated the elderly, not just the attitude of serving others.\n\nProfessor Cheung is very familiar with the organization, thereby easy to communicate when encountering problems. For example, when the number of students enrolled in the course increased from 30 to 60, she actively discussed with the organization about adjusting the arrangement and the organization also shared their difficulties. The two parties held positive attitudes to solve problems. The communication with the kindergartens was also similar. The kindergarten activities were more of a large-scale that university students needed to serve hundreds of children. Before the event, the principal would be invited to Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) to watch videos of the previous events with the current university students and to get to know the preparations of the current events. After the establishment of an activity plan, one or two persons-in charge from the kindergarten would talk about and prepare for the implementation of the sports meeting with the university students. Face-to- face meetings and negotiations help both parties to understand the needs and solve problems in a timely manner. Professor Cheung mentioned that direct communication with kindergarten teachers was equally important. Discussion allowed kindergarten teachers to know the plans of the university students and the kindergarten teachers could give timely feedback as well."

Teamwork is an ability that HKBU values and through group collaboration and oral presentations, students’ skills can be promoted and students can grow out of the challenges. For example, students had to complete an oral report within 5 minutes and it is to be a stress-coping exercise. Another example was that when team members had disputes and conflicts, Professor Cheung would meet with the whole team to discuss how to get along and cooperate with different people, how to adjust themselves, and how to assign roles and apply specific strategies in group work. As a facilitator, Professor Cheung would focus on how to help students learn and handle situation."

The service activities developed at that time mainly consisted of two parts. For the first part, it involved direct teaching to kindergarten children to develop fundamental motor skills. Through drawing lots, the second part was divided into locomotor skills (e.g. running around) and manipulation skills (e.g. how to control the object). Accordingly, the university students were divided into two groups to design activities, and finally the activities would be integrated to form a game and to become a part of the he kindergarten’s sport meeting, allowing the participation of 400 to 600 children and parents. For instance, if the results of drawing lots were running and throwing balls, the two activities of running and throwing balls would be integrated into one game.\n\nIn addition, the university students also needed to provide services for the next-door elderly center. Meanwhile, they had the opportunity to contact children and the elderly to compare how the children differed from the elderly in terms of muscle development and muscle movements."

This table listed the standard for each action, such as the standard of running skills and focusing skills. University students had to record whether children had reached the standard of each movement while observing. Therefore, in the sports meeting, university students not only helped facilitating the recording, but also had the opportunities to apply the contents learned in the class and observed the differences between children at different ages and differences between parents. Such reflection record enabled students to understand the muscle status of people at different ages."

Each group of students was required to submit a service activity proposal for the games and lesson plans they had designed. The event design must be completed within 6 weeks. Clear instructions and requirements made it easy for students to engage in. Professor Cheung also observed that students had better learning performance.\n\nUniversity students had to refer to a certain amount of academic literature references for the submission of a proposal. For example, students had to find four to six articles related o physical fitness and motor development for adults.

Therefore, if students were absent, their scores would be deducted by 5 points as punishment. In group tasks, in order to promote all group members to engage in group activities, Professor Cheung added a best team member award and if 50% or more of the team members thought that one student was the best team member, that student could have extra points. Accordingly, “worst team member” was also set up that if one team member was rated as the worst team member by 50% or more team members, she would deduct a certain point from his/her scores. The purpose of peer evaluation was to enhance university students’ engagement into the group activities, but the deduction was not an end in itself. In the past, Professor Cheung would have a separate meeting with the students who were selected as the worst team members to understand their situation and give reminders. In this case, the students’ scores would be deducted by 0.5 points. Although the deduction was not much, it allowed students to be aware of their own shortcomings in order to improve their behaviors. Furthermore, Professor Cheung also requested students to report the group’s assignment as well as the proportion of each task. Students needed to sign their names to acknowledge that everyone was satisfied with the division of labor. This approach helped to promote students’ responsibilities and engagement.\n\nAfter completing the service activities, the university students needed to finish individual reports. The purpose of this homework was to remind students to carefully observe the physical and motor skills of the elderly during the service process. This observation was related to the literature assigned for reading by the students in the previous homework. For example, if a student selected the literature about physical strength of the elderly to review, he/she should observe the corresponding targeted service recipients in the activities and record the observations so as to distinguish between the elderly and the children."

The time for each student to interact with the elderly had decreased when the pairing ratio changed from 1:1 to 1:2, which also affected the atmosphere of the service activities.\n\nThe university has begun to provide small grants for service learning courses, and senior students or graduates can be invited to provide advice and support on the service site, or to complete in-depth interviews to help improve the course. However, the core work, such as the communication and coordination with the organization, must be carried out by the teachers themselves.

        content: "Case 4 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled “Community Engagement through Service-Learning” (Hereinafter referred to as Community). This course was offered by Ms. CHAN, Wing-yee, Constance, she is from Lingnan University.\n\nThe course Community has been set up for more than four years. Different from other service- learning courses, Ms. Chan’s course was centered on the concept and practice of service learning. The course aims to enhance students’ self-understanding and the understanding of community through various interactive teaching and learning activities. This course provides an introduction to, and overview of, S-L theory and practice, the institutions of welfare and service providers, and the emergence of social enterprises as well as local and global social and environmental issues. Students have the opportunity for hands-on service project designed by themselves under the guidance of the course instructors and/or community supervisor(s). Through the group project, students have the chance to understand a specific community and meet the community needs, and think critically about the issues involved. The course also help students understand the importance of reflection and ways of doing it effectively. Students are expected to learn autonomously, and to collaborate with their fellows, alongside regular supervision by the instructors.\n\nFor classroom learning, Ms. Chan introduced different aspects of service learning which included the historical background, theory, assessment methods, research skills, and methods for assessing community needs. According to specific service recipients and service activities at each semester, the instructor would introduce and discuss related social issues in the classroom. For example, some organizations focused more on the topic of dementia for the elderly. Then, in class, more discussion were tailored for exploring aging issues. For service projects related to the grass-root life of the society, the social issues, for example, poverty, global citizens and even social entrepreneurship companies would be explored. Students had the opportunity to delve into these issues, and learn more about how different organizations and groups responded to these issues.\n\nThe instructor took students to different communities to understand the needs of the service recipients and then designed specific service learning projects/activities to meet the needs of the society. Different from other service-learning courses, the course Communty was more flexible in the development and selection of the service organizations. The instructor also had the opportunity to find cooperative organizations based on her personal background, expertise, and relationships with the organizations. Ms. Chan has a social work background, which makes her focus more on specific issues in the society, such as poverty and women. When searching for organizations, Ms. Chan hopes to extend the scope of Lingnan University’s existing service activities and also discuss possible service activities with the existing partner organizations."

For example, partner organizations were working on food collection or women’s empowerment activities. The instructor would give introduction to students about women’s empowerment and the interested students could form a group and went to the center to learn more about the organizations and service recipients in the community and their specific needs.

Both parties would be more active in collaborations and would reach agreements more easily for service projects.\n\nOn the contrary, when universities and organizations do not have sufficient trust and understanding, to ensure the effectiveness of the service activities, additional manpower is often required. As a result, too much resources are invested and this affects subsequent cooperation. For instance, Ms. Chan worked with a center which serves cancer patients, and the center wanted university students to help members write their life stories. The center had high expectations for story writing. As it was unsure whether the university students could complete the story writing with satisfaction, a clinic psychologist was arranged to cooperate with the students to edit, interview and follow up the writing of each story. In the end, although the center was satisfied with the story, the overloaded manpower and massive time investment suspended the follow-up cooperation. If the two parties had a better understanding with each other beforehand, it would be better for them to have a clear understanding of their inputs and expectations before cooperation."

For example, in a reflection meeting, she firstly gave students pieces of paper and magazines, and then facilitated students’ reflection and writing with three questions. Students had to choose one color to represent their feeling of participating in the service activity. Students would also choose from the magazines and materials provided the social issues observed from the community and to give suggestions for improving the service activities. Students within their groups could share and further discuss according to their own paintings.\n\nIn addition, at the beginning of each lesson, students reported project progress. The instructor and the other groups of students gave feedback. In Ms. Chan’s view, the service activities of each group were not the activities of individuals but the whole class. That is, each group’s sharing allowed the other groups of students to give suggestion and advice. When a group needed help, other groups of the students could provide assistance. These promoted the atmosphere of mutual support, leading to the common objective of service-learning. During this process, students had the opportunity to learn from each other and found out they could be complementary to each other with their own strengths and weaknesses. This process facilitated students’ abilities to seek help, cooperate with others and solve problems. For example, when a group of students completed a women-related service activity, they considered whether they could launch a “community kitchen” activity which would be inviting women to cook with the university students in the service activity. During the planning process for the event, Ms. Chan found that it was not easy to find a venue suitable for dozens of people. With responsible students in class mentioned this need, everyone discussed the suitable venues together, and came up with a study room ran by students.

When students participated in a group in handling service activities, they saw that many students were active and engaged. During this process, students observed each other and heard stories of different service recipients. Many interpersonal interactive situations affected students, allowing them to know more about themselves, the society, and the service recipients. This process of continuously understanding and discovery strengthen the power to change students. Many students often mentioned at the last sharing session that they found out that instead of serving others, they were actually served by others. Students had not thought that many could learn many things from the women and the elderly. In addition, they could not ever thought that they had to face issues in their twenties and had not considered the value of the family.

Social workers were well aware of the focus of the course, and they could play the roles of co-educators to help students sort out and deepen their experience in service activates. It was more effective for the social workers in the organization to point out the free-riders or students’ poor performance because the social workers directly expressed their expectations and unsatisfactory work areas.

The program was gradually developed to become a course, and by 2010, it already contained all necessary elements that a course should have which included a series of concepts and theoretical knowledge; specific schedules; the requirements for students to apply what they had learned to service activities, and assessment to evaluate students’ learning outcomes. Students’ efforts and learning outcomes, at that time, even exceeded the requirements of the course with three credits. To this end, a book was written to introduce the content and development of the whole project.\n\nBeginning in 2012, in response to the reform of the university academic system which was to change for three years to four years of university study. Universities have been reviewing and restructuring university courses under the new academic system since 2005. Taken this opportunity, Dr. Ngai's team began to seek the possibility of transforming this program to a credit-bearing course. The new Academic Vice-President has supported the effectiveness of this program. In 2012-13, with the introduction of general education courses in the university, Technology became one of the general education courses for all students of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) students."

They involve 1) concept and practice of service-learning; 2) discipline-specific concepts, issues and skills; 3) project-specific concepts, issues and skills;\n\nApart from discipline-Specific lectures and seminars and Project-Specific seminars, the students were also required to complete an e-Learning Model and participate in a Service- Learning project, which was designed to develop students’ creativity, problem-solving, teamwork and communication abilities.

The relationship established by the need of service learning course involves the relationship between multiple stakeholders: university students want to get good grades, teachers want students to learn while helping the society, and cooperative organizations would like help the community to become better. Cooperating with a new partner needs a process of mutual understanding, running-in, and consultation. Different institutions have different ideas and expectations. For example, if an organization has worked with many volunteers, it tends to treat students as volunteers rather than developing equal and mutually beneficial collaborative activities. In addition, it takes time to build trust between universities and partners. Mutual understanding and trust can enable us to continue to negotiate new activities and expand opportunities for service and cooperation. The process of continuous interaction and renewal can enhance the quality of mutual cooperation and achieve a win-win situation.\n\nAll these require the universities and partners to develop mature relationships. A continuous cooperation with the same organization can also help to foresee the difficulties and challenges that students will encounter in the process of participation, and accordingly, we can turn these possible situations into learning opportunities in a planned system. The unexpected circumstances for students may be taken as experience for students while teachers are making plans, so that the students may grow from setbacks. If it is a matter of safety or too difficult for students to handle, the instructor will inform the students in advance some related strategies against those accidents /crises."

The initial adjustment was conducted based on the previous service outreach program, where students learned about the impacts of computers on people and the world. That is, in service activities, students needed to apply computers to help the community to solve specific problems. With the changes of the students’ enrollment in the course, who were mostly freshmen and sophomores, the focus of course was extended to the role of technology in human life. For example, without the knowledge of electronic decoding, some elderly could not use e-banking and some corresponding e-services, such as logging into the government's official websites and registering for the passport. The function of technology in human life is reflected in the requirement for users to master technology. Therefore, the course and service activities focused on how to use technology to help people live. Thus, specific service activities include e-learning education, STEM, robot programming, installation of information technology, supporting information technology, designing computer games for children with intellectual disabilities, and etc.\n\nIn terms of course structure, one-third of the course was to learn the theoretical framework in the classroom. Then students needed to complete at least 40 hours of local service activities, and a minimum 60 hours of the overseas service activities. The remaining one- third of the course was for students to complete their own learning activities, prepare for the service, develop small games in the laboratory, or conduct reflection after the service. For a three credit- bearing course, students have to spend about 120 hours."

On the one hand, students should conduct service activities practically helpful to the society or the service recipients, rather than simply comforting the souls of the service recipients. On the other hand, university students should not just for completing a machinery task. They should also benefit from the service activities and have a deeper understanding of the society from a macro perspective. For example, when university students went to a poor region, they might need to complete specific task such as “pulling the wire”. Apart from pulling the wire, they needed to understand the energy poverty of the region/country, and the impact of electricity on personal life and even the development of the whole community. This kind of reflection was designed to allow students to integrate their 'individuals' into society. This was not a separate phenomenon but a social issue. In addition, service activities focused on specific facilities that helped university students gain satisfaction in learning and service.\n\nWhen task objectives were challenging, but university students could handle them, they were more willing to participate in it, and the effectiveness of the activity allowed students to see the real effects, which might be relatively simple. For example, a village with no electricity in the past was then facilitated with lights. For the help available to a society/community, university students would recognize the value of such learning. Also, students could see that they could achieve. For another example, Dr. Ngai once took students to a school with special education needs to design some therapeutic games. She observed that university students were afraid of those students with special needs and students with physical disabilities. After getting to know those people, the university students slowly learned that the SEN students were safe and they began to overcome their psychological fears. From 'fear' to “in fact, it’s not so terrible”, this slowly turned into “we are helping them.” During this process, we could see how students recognize that they could complete projects to improve the community and the people who live in it.\n\nIn the process of improving the community, Dr. Ngai hoped that students could meet people living in communities where resources and technology were scarce, and to observe how their lives were influenced by technology. Understanding social issues is not only about improving the material conditions of the community, but also understanding the people and their living conditions. Therefore, during the process of proposal design and reflection, Dr. Ngai put more emphasis on guiding students to think about what they could contribute to these people/these communities, in order to cultivate students' empathy. To achieve such effect, the instructor needed to spend time to consider from several perspectives: discussing the feasibility and possible effects with the cooperation organizations, ensuring the feasibility of these projects, the challenges brought to students during the process of completing the equipment/facilities, reservation of time for students to reflect on and discuss the task completion. If the students were unable to complete the project, the partner would not be satisfied and the students would feel that they were not supported."

The review was conducted through face-to-face interaction at the service site and would not be graded so as to reduce students’ pressure.\n\nIn this service-learning process, the instructor's personal example demonstrated a role model to trigger students’ reflection. Students would observe things such as instructors’ confidence in dealing with people in the community, their familiarity with the operation of the community and institutions, and their care for the students. All these could be the direct source of what the students could learn, because the students would reflect on the teachers’ behaviors as role model. For example, Dr. Ngai led university students to take care of some children with hyperactivity. The moments they walked in, the children came up to shake hands with Dr. Ngai. Dr. Ngai not only let them hold hands, but also picked up the children.

The score distribution of the three phases of assessment is roughly 3-4-3. Instructors in individual subjects can subdivide and make specific requests for the requirements of the course.\n\nThe preparation stage of the Technology course includes three requirements. First, students need to prepare an implementation plan in groups, which takes up 10% of the performance scores, and the feasibility of the plan was the focus of evaluation. Second, students need to complete a personal reflection report as in the preparation stage, it involves the impacts, advantages and concepts of technology. Through reflection reports, students could systematically contemplate the relationship between technology and humans. This reflection report would account for 15% of the score. Third, students' participation and performance in the class would contribute to part of the score. Although there are variations each year, this part of score generally maintains at 5%. The score of the implementation phase accounts for 40%. The assessment would cover two items. The first item is the quality of service activities which accounts for 10-15% of the score. It is based on small groups’ performance. The second item is about students’ attitude, such as their commitments and contributions to the group activities. These are obtained through instructor’s observation on the site for a long time. Students’ reflection accounts for 30% of the total score, and they have to complete 2-3 individual reflection journals or reflection reports.

This course was offered by Dr. Theodore Lee, he is from the Education University of Hong Kong.\n\nRather than a course designed from the perspective of a certain subject knowledge, this course focused on making students understand individual social responsibility and most importantly, deepening their understanding through demonstration. By engaging students in working with different NGOs, Dr. Lee wanted students to understand how an organization viewed its mission and social responsibility, and how social workers and employees interpreted their work. If students had the chances to have direct contact with the service recipients, students could learn what these people really needed and why they needed it in a specific social context. These experiences enabled students to learn their social responsibilities. At the same time, their social responsibilities could be demonstrated concretely and students got to know how to use the resources they had to give back to the society.\n\nIn the course Working, students would go to different types of NGOs and participated in the work assigned by the organization. Through observation, interview, communication and direct involvement in daily work, students got to know how NGOs fulfilled their social missions.\n\nPrior to the service activities, students learnt theories and concepts about social responsibilities in the classroom. The instructor would also invite colleagues of the service agency to share how they completed their daily work, how they perceived the meaning of their work and the social issues, how they solved problems to improve the community.

Therefore, the nature and scope of the service activities were more flexible when compared with other service-learning courses. Students could participate in any part of the NGOs’ work, focusing on the process of observation, communication with others, consideration about social issues and the NGOs’ missions, and engagement with the society.

The tasks in the service activities could be diverse. Students could take up the paperwork in the office, prepare and implement a project or directly interact with the service recipients, such as walking with the elderly or farming. In this process, on one hand, students gained different kinds of experiences. Diversified experiences helped students realize that social responsibilities could be fulfilled through a variety of activities and channels. These understandings and experiences motivated students to reflect on how they would do in the future, how they would practise their personal social responsibility in the future and further facilitated students’ willingness to care more about the society.\n\nOn the other hand, students had the opportunity to discover that the NGOs’ jobs were not what they thought. Students, then, realized that there were variety of daily work for the NGOs, including a lot of boring tasks, such as advertisement promotion, sorting envelopes, entering data, and making many phone calls. Students got to know that not all tasks in the NGOs involved a direct contact with the service recipients.

Instructors, thus, can find possible partners inside the resource pool. It will be easier for colleagues who have few contacts with the NGOs.\n\nAnother challenge comes from the time students spend participating in the service. Since the service time will only be calculated when students worked inside the NGOs, there would be time costs involved in completing the service, especially the EdUHK is relatively remote. Some students needed spend 4 hours to do the service activities each time, but the actual service time was only about 1-3 hours."

These two courses were offered by Dr. Patrick Ying Kit YUE, he is from Hong Kong Baptist University.\n\nPrior to taking note of service-learning, Dr. Yue had some insights and explorations on non- traditional teaching methods. He believed that traditional classrooms are often dull and lack of vitality. Instructors talked blindly to the PPT, and students sat in front of the podium and listened tediously. Therefore, in order to break the boredom of the classroom and engaged students in learning, he would try different teaching methods. For example, before implementing service-learning, he worked with the school library and used an online platform to teach some parts of the courses. He hoped to use the online platform to allow students to analyze and learn by themselves, instead of simply listening to him in the classroom.\n\nIn March 2018, Dr. Yue met his colleague Cindy from the Centre for Innovative Service- Learning (CISL) at a teaching sharing meeting. During the conversation, he formally got in touch of the concept of service-learning. Prior to that, he did not know much about the concept and practice of service-learning. However, CISL was willing to assist him in this teaching attempt, and he was also interested in non-traditional teaching methods, so he hit it off and had a service-learning plan later.\n\nIn September 2018, Dr. Yue tried the first time to add the elements of service-learning to his course 'FERMENTATION & ENZYME TECHNOLOGY'. From the drafting of the plan to the implementation of the course, the time is tight yet the support was far from sufficient. 'This is a process of constantly encountering hardship and continuous learning. After all, it is my first time doing it. Before, I did not have any knowledge and experience about service- learning,' Dr. Yue said in the interview. In the course Fermentation, university and secondary school students were paired to work on interactive activities related to fermentation and science.University students designed games and case studies to introduce fermentation and its application to daily lives. In particular, students demonstrated how fermentation could achieve zero food waste and make garbage enzymes for cleaning purposes. The students also designed innovative recipes and prepare snacks that involve the use of fermentation.\n\nDuring the first developmental process about service-learning, Dr. Yue accumulated a lot of experiences, and he knew what needed attention and what needed to be improved, and he applied his learning from these experiences to subsequent developments. By the time the second course was launched in January 2019, he had already been experienced in the design and implementation of the service-learning process. He had re-arranged his practices on motivating students, connecting institutions and controlling time. This course provides general knowledge about toxicology, routes of human exposure to toxic chemicals, and biological responses to toxicants. Students acquired methods for evaluating potential toxicity and applications of toxicological data to assess potential health. To put these theories into practices, students conducted an advocacy campaign in a secondary school with a focus on microplastics.\n\nAfter two attempts, he could have more appreciation and understanding of service- learning. In the future, he stated that he would explore service-learning more."

Then, the content of this part was replaced with service-learning activities. Dr. Yue needed a more appropriate design to link service-learning with the curriculum. For this reason, before the commencement of the first service-learning course, he discussed with the colleagues in CISL many times, and finally decided to work with the social worker Toby, who was recommended by the Faculty of Social Sciences to jointly design the theme activity of 'fermenting life'.\n\nThe service activity was conducted on a Saturday. It comprised three parts. For the first part, Toby was invited to share what was 'fermented life', which he mainly used the concept of 'fermentation' to metaphorize life,that was, the process of 'fermentation' required rigorous procedures for its nurture. Just like life, we needed to accumulate our knowledge well and to carefully handle every important step. The second part was a scientific experiment and it was mainly taught by Dr. Yue, who would teach some simple scientific knowledge about fermentation. The third part was the responsibility of university students. The students would be grouped and they were to prepare a demonstration of fermented food. This process required the students to master the relevant knowledge learned in the classroom, and translated it into applications to allow the secondary school students to learn.\n\nIn the second course, 'Environmental Health and Toxicology', there was a change in the arrangement which the secondary school students and university students would work together to do the presentation. There were seven topics in total, and the discussion would focus on the topics of 'environmental health' and 'toxic food'. In this process, the university students used the knowledge they acquired to assist the secondary school students to do a group display together. It served both a knowledge transfer and an offer of service to the secondary school students. Dr. Yue believed that these learning outcomes could not be achieved by other homework assignments.\n\nPrior to the commencement of service in each of two courses, Dr. Yue would ask the students to write a detailed activity plan and prepared a budget to facilitate the allocation of funds.

So, when it came to the second service-learning course, Dr. Yue chose to include the service time for the calculation of the class time, and the students had no complaints in this regard. In addition, Dr. Yue understood that since the students of the first course were the students of the fourth year and they were busy after class. They would be more sensitive to the occupation of their time after class. The second course was for students in the second year, and there was no complaint about the timing."

In about 2011, service-learning was held as some forms of extra-curricular activities. From 2012 to 2013, the coordinator of this course, who was his PhD supervisor, add some elements of service-learning into the course, such as inviting the elderly to come to the class. Until 2016, the coordinator successfully applied for a two-year UGC’s teaching and learning fund and service-learning could then be formally integrated into the course and which had been running for almost two to three years in 2019.\n\nDr. Cheung mentioned that there were several differences between service-learning held before and after it was integrated into the course curriculum. He continued that firstly, a rubric was developed for this service-learning part of the course now. Before, service- learning was more like internship and some elderly people were invited to class. Under instructors’ guidance, university students would help them conduct body-check for one to two times in the class. In this way, students simply established some medical records. Now, a course document was developed along with the rubric, which accounted for 15% of the course. Secondly, students’ assignment was different after the development of the rubric. The assignment was adjusted from simply preparing medical records to establishing a e-portfolio with the inclusion of service-learning elements such as debriefing and reflective journal which were to be done by students. The nature of the service-learning had also changed. Before, the students only met the elderly once. Now, the students would follow up the elderly cases for the whole year."

            text: "The course Bone Injury and Massage in Traditional Chinese Medicine was run in two semesters. It included classroom teaching and a variety of students’ active engagement and learning activities. There were five credits for this course, with four credits for the lecture and one credit for the practice.\n\nThe purpose of the course was to integrate the previously learning from Chinese and Western medicines’ courses into the current (learning) (course) contents. Through this course, students could meet the expectations of acquiring the professional knowledge and skills, and lay a solid foundation for the clinical practice of “bone injuries and massage” in the future. This course aims to enable students to grasp the relevant professional contents of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Practitioner Examination to meet the requirements of Chinese medicine registration. Moreover, it aims to allow students to understand how to further study and develop the skills for lifelong learning.\n\nIn order to integrate the service-learning element into the course, two types of service activities were arranged both in semester one and two: an on-site visit to the elderly home and the invitation of the elderly to visit the university. Specifically, five students formed into one team and each student team was responsible for taking care of one elderly person. One teacher and one social worker joined a student team for giving guidance. From around September to December, each team of five students visited five different elderly people. During the on-site visit, one student of the team who was responsible for the specific elderly person, led the visit and the other four students served as back-up support to check the bone condition of the elderly. Dr. Cheung mentioned that the rationale behind such arrangement was to ensure the safety of the elderly. Another reason was to allow more chances for students to have discussions about the analysis of the problems of the elderly and the identification of the solutions accordingly. By October, all the elderly people were invited to visit the university. The university students, at that time, tried to provide treatment for the elderly to ease their bone pains."

When the elderly came to the campus, students did diagnostic tests and sometimes under teachers’ guidance, had the chance to conduct treatments, which involved Chinese acupuncture, bone- setting massage and etc., to restore the joints’ health of the elderly. Although students could learn how to analyze and perform treatment from the medical courses in small group teaching, many of them felt scared to put what they had learnt into real practice. They might be afraid of communicating with the patients, or even so panic that they forgot things learnt from the book in front of the elderly. Through service-learning, students could have the chance to get down into real practice and overcome their psychological problems. Dr. Cheung also pointed out that the relationship between doctor and patient could never be clearly explained through the classroom teaching. Only through field practice could students have the chance to handle the relationship with the patients. For instance, he mentioned that an elderly person was very dependent on a student that he called the student 6 times to ask questions. The student was very stressful and did not know how to deal with it. However, this situation would apparently happen when the students become a doctor as they need to communicate with patients about their health problems and conditions. Therefore, pre- practice through service-learning allows students to get familiar with ways to handle problems and to some extent, this process facilitates their learning progress as well as preparing them for becoming a doctor."

There would be two on-site visits. Through on-site visits, Dr. Cheung wants students to know that as doctors, they should not only be able to heal the patients, but also to get to know their living conditions. Doctors only get to know the patients when they come for consultation. Nevertheless, doctors, sometimes, have no idea of the patients’ situation before and even after the consultation. Dr. Cheung mentioned that in fact, there are many factors influencing the health conditions of a person, for instance, patients’ living environment, their relationship with the family, and their living habits. The concept of the on-site visit is for students to know the elderly’ living conditions and at the same time, to gain access to information about the medicines that they are taking. All these factors mentioned would affect the health of the elderly."

E-portfolio included two parts: the first one was to build up health documents for the elderly to keep track of their bone-related health condition. The second one was documenting students’ reflection of what they had learned during the service activities, with no provision of guidelines.\n\nA debriefing session was held every semester. Every group of five to six students would also have the debriefing session with the facilitation of two to three teachers. The debriefing lasted from one to one and half hours. Therefore, there were at least two debriefing sessions for every student to discuss their problems related to professional treatment or on-site visits. Dr. Cheung also creatively used mobile apps to follow up students’ problem immediately. He used Whatsapp to create a discussion group for the whole class and even respective discussion groups individually for each group of students. Any students could raise their problems in the groups and the students could discuss the problems together.

For the formal assessment, scores will be given for students’ team-based presentation and e-portfolio. For the first semester, team-based presentation requires students as a group to share the discussion about a case about an elderly’s health and also things that students have learnt. In the second semester, every student needs to make a e-portfolio. The e-portfolio includes two parts, with one part professionally recording the elderly’s health condition in bones injury and another part completing a reflective journal. For the reflective journal, there are no specific guidelines for the written contents.\nInformal assessment mainly involves social workers to provide written comments based on seven criteria for students’ graduation. The social workers not only act as back-ups to handle the elderly’s health condition after the service, but also participate in giving students’ comments based on their observation. However, Dr. Cheung mentioned that the comments would not be counted into students’ GPA because social workers would be hesitating and nice in evaluation so as not to affect the students. He added that the reasons for engaging the social workers in the assessment were to let students care of the elderly from the perspective of the social workers in addition to that from the doctors. In this way, students’ civic awareness can be raised and they would be more willing to solve problems from the elderly’s perspective. Dr. Cheung hopes that students not only can heal the elderly, but can also stand in the elderly’s shoes, thus promoting their empathy."

He said that he was professional in medical knowledge, however, he lacked a lot of knowledge in other domains, such as educational assessment. CISL, to some extent, helped him to design a rubric for assessment. With the rubric, it was easier for him to give scores, and convince students to understand the importance of service-learning in the course. Another point worth mentioning was that the platform also allowed Dr. Cheung to meet different NGO partners and learn from other teachers’ service-learning course design. For example, Dr. Cheung said that he found out that other courses, such as marketing, creative writing and mathematics, could also integrate service-learning activities. Such exposure enabled him to think outside of the box as a doctor.\nMoreover, he viewed that the platform provided by the CISL facilitated students and teachers to value the significance of the service-learning course. He added that CISL would make posters for each course. With posters, both teachers and students felt that they had ownership of their work. Most importantly, both teachers and students felt that senior managers acknowledged their efforts, which, in turn, facilitated their motivations."

Dr. Xu and Dr. Leung (Ka-wai), with the help of the Student Affairs Office (SAO) in The EdUHK, came to know that the NGO Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (H.K.F.Y.G.) was struggling about the progress of a tutoring program. Specifically, the NGO at that time was implementing a tutoring program with the aim to enhance the learning motivation and autonomy of underprivileged primary school students.\nThe tutors running the program did not have relevant educational background and lacked professional knowledge. Therefore, after some time, they encountered a bottleneck in work progress despite that the program was still running very smoothly. Many primary school students were very poor in English and Mathematics subjects, but the tutors did not know how to improve their knowledge of these subjects. These underprivileged students were less motivated to study at schools as a result.\nAt that time, Miss Leung from EdUHK was running a course “Services for the poor and needy”, which aimed to cultivate university students to be more responsible and to show more empathy for needy people. Another Miss Leung (Connie), from the Language Centre of HKBU, who always led university students to teach English to children who had relatively low language abilities. EdUHK and HKBU thought that it would be a good opportunity for them to collaborate with the NGO to help the needy children. Teachers from the two universities, with their professional expertise, could lead the university students and instill effective teaching theories for tutoring primary school students to have better learning outcomes. The university students could then tutor the homework done by the primary school students while enhancing their hands-on experience related to the two courses that they were taking. This collaboration could also enable the NGO to have more professional resources of teaching materials developed by the university students as well as manpower to enhance the learning motivation of the primary school students."

For instance, most of the EdUHK students had learned a lot about teaching, such as time management and the teaching of subject knowledge.

Next week this group of students changed their teaching approach in such a way that they tried to ask the primary school students to do role-playing, which facilitated primary school students to better memorize the knowledge.\nAnother linkage was that the tutoring service could enable university students to enter the field to understand underprivileged people more and have the chance to analyze this contemporary issue in a community. This practical experience obtained by the university students enriched the meaning of their learning about the theories on service-learning and the concepts of serving the underprivileged people.

            text: "Professor Chen came to Lingnan University (LU) in the spring of 2012 and began to teach the course 'Strategy Management'. This course was originally designed by other colleagues. The content includes service-learning part and non-service-learning part. It is open to all students who are taking Bachelor of Business Administration. Professor Chen only taught the non- service-learning part in the first semester. In the second semester, at the suggestion of the department head, she started to try the service-learning part of the course. The second service-learning course that Professor Chen is responsible for is 'Leadership and Teamwork'. This course only includes service-learning format.\n\n'Strategic Management' is a course based on a team-based experiential learning project, which is divided into two parts: service-learning and non-service-learning. Students who enroll in this course can freely choose one of the parts.\n\nFor the service-learning part in the course, about 30 students will be divided into 5 or 6 groups. Under the arrangement of the course instructor, they would jointly provide consulting services on strategic management for a social enterprise. In this process, students do not need to serve the 'service recipients' directly, but provide 'indirect service' by giving consulting services on strategic management to the social enterprise. 'Students need to use the relevant knowledge of strategic management to help the organization handle some things based on the actual situation of the organization.' Professor Chen explained. The preparatory work process includes:\n\n\t(1) After the semester begins, students will meet with the person in charge of the partner institution to get a preliminary understanding of the institution.\n\t(2) Students visit the institution and conduct simple interviews with customers.\n\t(3) Train students to better understand the characteristics of the institution and service recipients\n\t(4) Students use the knowledge they have learned and provide services to the enterprise according to the specific situation of the enterprise.\n\nIn the non-service-learning part of the course, students also need to conduct activities in groups. The difference is that they need to find a company on their own instead of being arranged by the university. In the whole process, except for a few interviews, the main activity of the students is desk research. Unlike the minimum service hours of 30 hours in the service-learning part, there is no requirement for hours in the non-service-learning part, and no additional training is required in the preparatory stage of the activity.\n\nFor students, there were different unique experiences in the two courses. Professor Chen mentioned that in the service-learning part, students would take on more workload, including the need for additional training and the need to respond to the expectations of partner institutions. However, students could experience more real teaching and learning situations, and carry out more effective reflection. For students who chose the non-service-learning method, it would be more challenging to find a cooperative institution on their own.\n\nProfessor Chen said that compared to 'Strategic Management', the course 'Leadership and Teamwork' will be more open and unstructured. It has the following characteristics:\n\n(1) 'Leadership and teamwork' requires students to provide 'direct service'. For example, in a service which was to cooperate with the Elder Academy, students needed to serve the elderly in person, such as teaching them how to use smartphones.\n(2) This course is still taught in small classes, with 30 students in a class, divided into 6 groups. Unlike 'Strategic Management', this course requires each group to serve a different organization. Professor Chen explained that in the case of 'direct service', the service activities of each institution can accommodate fewer students. For example, in cooperation with the Elder Academy, there were only 8 students in a senior class, while the entire class had 30 university students. A single institution often could not match the number of students in a class of a university.\n(3) The composition of team members will have relatively detailed requirements. Students need to organize teams independently according to their gender, cultural background, language, major, personality (extroverted or introverted) and ability characteristics. Professor Chen explained that because this course is 'Leadership and Teamwork', the consideration of this arrangement is to enable students to adapt to working with people with different characteristics and learn from each other."

Professor Chen said that it was not difficult for students to meet this number of hours because the training time had already accounted for 8 hours. For students who want to do direct service, their extracurricular service time often exceeds 30 hours. As for students who provide indirect services, the time for group meetings and report writing will also be included in the service hours. So in general, such a regulation does not bring much challenge, and students can also benefit from it. For example, they can include service hours in their volunteer hours."

In order to ensure that the registration and questionnaire are completed effectively, the university will link the registration process with the graduation requirement and the student's application of funding for the course. If students fail to complete the registration, the relevant credits for service-learning cannot be registered, nor can they apply for funds in the course. The data for completing the questionnaires will be collected and stored by the Office of Service-learning (OSL). OSL will publish an annual report on service-learning every year."

Specifically, OSL has the network resources of relevant cooperative institutions. OSL will recommend some suitable institutions with reference to the needs of course instructors, and let the instructors choose by themselves. Before the commencement of the semester, if the initial impression of the recommended institution is good, an instructor will discuss with the institution some details, which include the service time and mutual expectations. If the instructor is not satisfied with the selected institution, he can let OSL continue to search and explore. Professor Chen said that through this arrangement, instructors could often find suitable institutions.\n\nAfter the matching is completed, a course instructor needs to undertake more communication work, such as discussing with the institution how to plan specific service arrangements. The follow-up contact with the institution, such as the cooperation with the same institution in the next year, is also the responsibility of the course instructor.\nIn the follow-up process, Professor Chen emphasizes the importance of establishing inter- institutional cooperation instead of interpersonal cooperation. It is because if it is cooperation between individuals, it is difficult to guarantee that the personnel of the organization will not change and this will affect the cooperation. If it is cooperation at the institutional level, newly appointed colleagues are often assigned to take over and be responsible for continuing the project. According to Professor Chen's experience, most of the replacement staff are relatively responsible and will take over the relevant work before the staff leaves."

            text: "Professor Chen said that cooperation with institutions was a two-way selection process. As course instructors, they need to attempt continuously to select and evaluate suitable institutions. In the first few years, Professor Chen tried to cooperate with different institutions which served different service targets. She found that students were more capable to adapt to projects which targeted the elderly, women, and physically handicapped people because these clients could focus more on coping with and participating in activities. For projects that targeted young people and people with mental disabilities, students seemed to be helpless. She believed that the reason might be that students did not have sufficient knowledge and ability in developmental psychology to solve the problems of such service targets, so it was difficult to understand the logic behind their behaviors.\n\nBesides the selection, she believed that she should keep an open mind about her partners. For a while, she had not tried to cooperate with institutions that served the disabled, but after working with the AIDS Association, she found that the cooperation was smooth and effective. However, she also mentioned that although she wanted to try new cooperation opportunities, she 'doesn’t take too much steps at once.' That is to say, if you encounter an organization with smooth cooperation, you may wish to develop a long-term cooperative relationship. Cooperating with a familiar organization can greatly reduce the cost of running- in. Especially, in the 'Leadership and Teamwork' course, when the instructor needed to communicate with five organizations, the workload was quite heavy. 'If we can keep the three experienced organizations to continue cooperating in the second year, the workload will be reduced a lot and there will be more time to contact two new organizations,' Professor Chen explained."

For example, in 'Strategic Management', there was an institution that wanted students to do market surveys. Professor Chen designed the service based on this expectation. After setting five different perspectives, the five teams implemented their plans separately. In the reflection phase, each group could consult the institution from a different perspective. In addition, the questionnaire could also be divided into five aspects and each group was responsible for one aspect. Finally after discussion, ideas were consolidated into a questionnaire for implementation. When the data was retrieved, each team could analyze it from a different perspective."

After the consultation, she would discuss with students and explained the suggestions put forward by the institution, and finally came up with some solutions.\n\nAt Lingnan University, pre-service training is mainly provided by OSL. The training it provides is mainly be divided into two parts, one is more generic, and another part is for courses. For example, in a whole day of training, it would be about general knowledge and skills in the morning, and it would be based on the characteristics of the course itself in the afternoon. “OSL is very flexible. Many of our teachers' requirements for training can basically be met.“ Professor Chen said, “They are very professional. In the training session, I only need to put forward my expectations. They will try their best to provide assistance.” For example, Professor Chen had tried to organize courses to serve ethnic minorities. OSL then provided training similar to a cultural tour, taking students to visit mosques, tasting local food, and helping students understand their culture. In addition, OSL also provided training on the elderly and environmental protection topics, and had invited experts in related fields to share and talk."

In addition, students will conduct the 'direct service' process in groups, which may involve how the team handles and negotiates issues, and these are consistent with the course content."

She believes that this meaning overrides all curriculum goals. Some items have more explicit meaning, and some items have more implicit meaning. For example, for a fund-raising project for HIV patients, if it is only raising money, some students will find it not meaningful. What the instructor needs to do is to find a way to let the students understand the meaning behind.\nIn this regard, Professor Chen mainly considers two points: First, closely integrate the service with the curriculum, so that students feel that participating in the service can help them get high scores in their academic work. At least in the academic work, participating in the service is meaningful, which can promote their participation; the second is to make association with students' learning goals. The instructor must understand the students' learning goals and let them know that their participation in the project can benefit them and help them achieve their own goals."

According to her observation, there are three main learning goals for students:\n\n\t(1) Being instrumental, that is, it is helpful to oneself. For example, if students want to understand their grandmother's ideas and improve their relationship with her, they may choose to participate in service projects related to the elderly. For another example, some students hope to join the education industry in the future, so in order to enrich their experience, they will also choose projects related to youth education.\n\t(2) Being non-instrumental, starting from one's own interests. For example, because some students are interested in education, they will choose youth education services to learn more about students.\n\t(3) To meet graduation requirements. In LU, undergraduate students must choose at least one service-learning course at the enrollment stage. The university will start recommending the students to consider choosing relevant courses at their first year undergraduate study. However, according to Professor Chen's experience, there will always be a small number of students who are forced to choose a service-learning course at the end of the undergraduate programme, but most students, at least 95% of students,\nShe said that when she first came to Lingnan University, students were very resistant to service learning. The main reason might be that the workload of service learning was relatively heavy, but after that many years, students had improved their acceptance level of service learning. Some students even chose more than one service-learning courses."

For example, in 'Strategic Management', Professor Chen would invite an institution representative into the classroom. Students could ask him questions based on the problems encountered in their assignments. During that process, OSL would help to produce meeting minutes and distributed them to students afterwards. As for the 'Leadership and Teamwork' course, there were many cooperative organizations. It was impossible to invite all organization representatives. She had no choice but to do her best. If all the agency representatives were unable to attend, she would ask some questions in class with reference to the students' projects, let the students think and answer them, and let them give a small presentation. In this way, not only peer pressure could be exerted to urge each group to supervise each other, but could also discover some common problems, which the group could understand and overcome, thereby reducing some self-attribution frustrations sense.\nAt the end of the term, Professor Chen would let the students of 'Strategic Management' conduct self-reflection, and let the students of 'leadership and teamwork' add a team reflection on the basis of self-reflection. In addition to these two reflections, students would also be allowed to check each other (peer review/reflection), but the focus would still be on the first two reflection projects."

Professor Chen believes that this grading method is in line with the essence of 'indirect service', that is, 'consulting', and it also conforms to the course outline.\nIn the 'Leadership and Teamwork' course, due to the large number of service agencies, instructors cannot participate in the 'direct service' of students every time to see their performance, so the evaluation of student service performance is mainly based on their reflection and report. Professor Chen said that there might be elements of falsification in reflections and reports. She has also considered letting partner institutions grade students, but for now, the grading method is still mainly based on oral presentations, reflections and written reports. There are three reasons:\n\n\t(1) The identity of the cooperating institution is always an outside person, and it is difficult for students and instructors to agree to the grading power given to external personnel.\n\t(2) If institutional partners are involved in grading, students will worry that the relationship between themselves and the staff of the institution will affect the results of the grading.\n\t(3) The scores of different institutional partners have different subjectivity, and it is difficult to guarantee the fairness of the scores.\n\nHowever, in the 'direct service', Professor Chen will still try to participate in and communicate with students, and at the same time design a series of approaches to help herself evaluate the quality of student service which include:\n\n\t(1) Students are required to hold a group meeting once a week and record the process in a report. The instructor can see the content of the group meeting and the participation level of group members.\n\t(2) The student's service content outline and presentation PowerPoint must be submitted to the instructor.

Professor Chen believes that this is often caused by the fact that the assessment does not fit the actual situation well. Instructors need to constantly adjust the evaluation methods and content to fill in the gaps in evaluation. For example, in the initial evaluation, she did not require students to hold group meetings and record the content of the meetings, but only to evaluate the general performance of students through peer review. However, from the results, this process would miss lot of information, so she later added a series of measures to fill the gaps, including:\n\n\t(1) Hold a group meeting once a week, record the attending students, and submit the meeting minutes. As to how to write meeting minutes, Professor Chen will explain in class.\n\t(2) Submit the PPT about the service content, and let the students explain the execution logic and personal thinking in the report and personal reflection. This not only allows instructors to understand the service situation more effectively, but also improves the quality of service for students.\n\nIn addition, if the final examination can be well integrated with the service itself, it can also fill in some assessment gaps and increase student participation. For example, if the final test is set as a case analysis, if students fail to participate in the service-learning project well and do not have their own personal experience, they will not be able to understand and analyze the case well in the final examination, and the score will be relatively low. 'In this way, at least half of the students will be more engaged and involved,' Professor Chen said."

If a faculty member is unable to have publications consistently and steadily, then he needs to work hard for gaining the practices, such as consulting or being company executives, or carrying out service-learning projects, etc., in order to gain recognition from the university. Under this policy, for non-long-term contract teachers and teachers who have not yet gained certain academic achievements, developing service-learning is a relatively simple way to gain recognition. For teachers who have obtained long-term contracts and academic recognition, there may be two main factors that motivate them to carry out service- learning and these are to help their teaching and not to bring them extra or too much burden.\nIn addition, Professor Chen also believes that if there is university support, the threshold for faculty to participate in service-learning will be lowered. After all, if the university can provide support for training, funding, and partnership establishment, the workload of the faculty will be reduced."

Therefore, LU does not lack network resources in terms of institutional cooperation.\nWhen Professor Chen first came to LU, as a young faculty member, she was not familiar with service learning. At that time, OSL provided her with greater help. The following\n\n(1) Provide service-learning practice guidance (Mentoring): Most of the OSL staff have experience working with teachers in service-learning, and can directly give teachers advice on the implementation of service-learning.\n(2) Provide assistance in human resources: OSL helps to arrange interviews between students and service recipients, field trips and related consultation activities.\n(3) Help faculty and staff to establish a cooperative network (Networking): Professor Chen explained that OSL itself is also a teaching department that will teach some courses, so it will accumulate some cooperative resources. When teachers lack cooperative resources, they can seek help from OSL.\n(4) Provide funds: The financial assistance here is mainly used to purchase training courses and for daily expenses of the group. The daily expenses of the group include transportation and the purchase of activity materials, etc. 'The total cost will not be much and it is about HK$10,000 to 20,000 each course.' Professor Chen said.\n(5) Provide a discussion platform for service learning: There is a committee on service learning in OSL, which is responsible for reviewing all service-learning courses and conducting related discussions. 'For example, if I want to open a new service-learning course, or if I make change to a course, then we will exchange opinions on this discussion platform. We can also discuss policies on service-learning.' Professor Chen gave an example.\n\nOne thing has to be added is that OSL support is not bundled with the service-learning course, but the faculty and staff seek it out according to their own needs. Moreover, OSL's support is mainly in terms of cooperation and coordination, and it does not directly help teachers' teaching work.

For example, in the course of serving the elderly, because there were not enough elderly participants, students needed to do posters and road shows to attract elderly\n\n(5) Different cooperative institutions had different expectations for the number of services provided by students. For example, some institutions expected students to provide services four times, and some institutions expected six times. Then, students would complain and feel that different times of service would affect their final evaluation results. In this regard, Professor Chen would try to communicate and maintain balance, and would also explain to students that the final evaluation was not an evaluation of the entire project, but the process of service. Perhaps the performance of the service process was not ideal, but if there was reflection on the learning results, she would still give satisfactory scores."

This course was offered by Dr. Fong Jonathan, he is from Lingnan University.\n\nThis course gives a brief introduction to the Origin of Life and provides an understanding of the physical conditions that enable planet Earth to create and sustain life. A practical approach was adopted to arouse the curiosity and interest of the students in the subject in order to stimulate critical scientific thinking. The course addressed the basic chemistry and biochemistry of vital components for the living cell. The course explained the role and functions of the various organs and organelles in plants and animals.\n\nThe course “Life sciences: the way life works” aims to introduce the origin of life and provides an understanding of the physical conditions that enable planet earth to create and sustain life. A practical approach is adopted to arouse the curiosity and interest of the students in the subject in order to stimulate critical scientific thinking. With Dr. Fong’s connection, he managed to cooperate with the Ocean Park Hong Kong (香港海洋公園) (hereafter called the Ocean Park). Different from other courses which aimed to serve the elderly, in this “Life” course, students and the elderly went together to the Ocean Park to teach the visitors some knowledge about biology, such as shark and conservation. The Ocean Park wanted the visitors to learn more about knowledge of ocean protection. The practical experience for students not only help them broaden their knowledge scope, but also address life issues competently and with confidence. The intergeneration service activities allowed students to change their views towards the elderly and to learn more from them."

        content: "Dr. Fong thinks that it would be easily to conduct the service-learning course if it can be integrated into the existing and well-structured activities delivered by the community partners. Prior to the service-learning, he was planning to partner with a primary school. However, there were 35 students in his course and it was impossible that all of them came to teach in only one primary school. It would also become complicated if students were allocated to different schools and handled different projects and in such regard, Dr. Fong was concerned with the complexity of supervising different projects in one service-learning course. Therefore, he tried to look for existing activities that were of large scales yet very well-structured that students could just join to do service-learning. At that time, he had some friends working in the Ocean Park and they happened to have some projects that they could work together with Dr. Fong.\n\nAfter the confirmation of the partnership, students came to the Ocean Park and took up the roles to deliver the activities designed by the Ocean Park. Due to time constraint, Dr. Fong did not ask students to design the activities.\n\nAlso, he believed that his service-learning project could be delivered smoothly if he could integrate his course content into the structured programme already been available in Ocean Park. As a matter of fact, the Ocean Park had fruitful experience in organizing these activities. Moreover, most of the partners in the Ocean Park used to study in Lingnan University, and therefore they were familiar with the courses and students’ situation."

The addition of service-learning component in this course, to some extent, would be more attractive to students because through doing services, students experienced how they could apply what they had learnt from the class into reality and this even facilitated their understanding of the knowledge taught in class.\n\nFor instance, many tourists in the Ocean Park would come up with different questions that students, with insufficient background knowledge, could not answer immediately. Therefore, during breaks, the students would initiate to look for the answers by themselves through the internet. They would put more efforts in answering the tourists’ questions, which, in return, helped them develop self-learning habits. This learning process further facilitated their understanding of the learning contents."

That was, students might appreciate their learning opportunities more. Furthermore, students and the elderly not only conducted service together, but also had lunch break together. During the break time, they had the chance to discuss things other than things related to service-learning. This interaction time enhanced their relationship.\n\nDr. Fong added that the intergenerational learning experience also facilitated students to reflect on their behaviors. For example, most of the students were very shy during service- learning activities. After seeing that the elderly was very active in participation, students tended to do more reflections later on.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Fong mentioned that many students felt that the intergenerational learning experience changed their mindset towards the elderly.

        content: "Case 12 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled “News Writing” (Hereinafter referred to as Writing). This course was offered by Prof. Siu Yan-ho, he is from Lingnan University.\n\nProf. Siu Yan-ho first came into contact with service-learning in 2015. At that time he worked with a professor to teach the course 'Classical Fiction'. With the collaboration with the Elder Academy, this course uses the method of “life retrospective narrative, and combines literary creation and interviews to help students understand the process of literary creation. During this process, Dr. Siu gains a lot of experience in service-learning, including how to cooperate with organizations, the formulation of processes and goals, the guidance of writing, and conducting interviews. The accumulation of these experiences has helped him follow up the development of service-learning courses in the future.\n\nIn 2016-2017, Dr. Siu started to independently teach a service-learning course, namely 'news writing'. This course inherited the interview and writing model of 'classical novels'. The service target was still mainly the elderly. It was launched with the theme of 'Hong Kong in 1950' and with the purpose to integrate the interview writing knowledge acquired in the classroom and service-learning, and to let students practice what they had learned. He said that there were three main reasons for the choice of the theme of interviewing the elderly and Hong Kong in 1950: First, Dr. Siu was interested in the study of Hong Kong literature and culture after the World War II, that is, after 1950. However, there was a lack of relevant information during that period and little could be understood. Through the survey through interview with the elderly, this missing part of the research data could be supplemented; second, he felt that the elderly of this age group were old and if that was not done at that time, there might not be any chance in the future. In addition, most of the elderly that he had contacted with had primary cognitive impairments. Even if they were in good health, their memory would inevitably deteriorate. Therefore, it would be better to do interviews and conduct surveys promptly with this group of old people whenever possible. Third, Dr. Siu believed that the history of Hong Kong in the 1950s and 1960s should be retained. He treated the retention of such history his personal responsibility to the Hong Kong community. He felt that this historical memory was precious and important to the interviewed elders, their families and communities.\n\nIn 2017-2018, Dr. Siu continued to work with the elderly centre in Hung Shui Kiu, but the theme was changed to 'Hong Kong in 1960' because the university wanted the instructors to present different courses. In addition, he had also increased the cooperation with other organizations, and the service target was still the elderly. The other organizations included were about food therapy services with the School of Chinese Medicine of Hong Kong Baptist University, co-organizing an exhibition of an era with Tai Kwun, and he also tried to move to Taiwan to have practice and to further enrich the curriculum model and outputs."

The service-learning module is also known as the 'new writing service research plan' and it mainly contains two major parts, namely 'interview with people' and 'local topics'. In the 'interview with people' part, the students will form a group of two, and each group will interview an elderly to understand his life in Hong Kong in the 1950s, and gradually explore and understand the events experienced by the elderly and the related cultural context behind them. In the 'local topics' part, students had to have a deep understanding of the local community, including the need for field trips, discovering problems, collecting and integrating data, etc., and then discussing local issues through text, presenting the development of community history and the changes past and present.\n\nThe specific course content and arrangement are as follows:\n\n\t(1) Historical research: Students investigate and understand the background in the early stage before the service delivery, which helps the offering of the services that follow. For example, to communicate with the staff of the elderly center to understand the background of the elderly prior to the 'interview with people', or to pay field visit and collect information during the exploration of the 'local topic'.\n\n\t(2) Visits: Students have to conduct three interviews with the elders. For the first time, it aims to get acquainted with the elders and establish a relationship with them. The second visit is to define the scope of research, service and the subsequent articles. In the third visit, the students should have established a clear theme. Through interviews, the writing materials will be supplemented, or more detailed materials can be obtained orally, so that more in-depth character descriptions or plot narratives can be achieved.\n\n\t(3) Consultation interviews: Students need to conduct four consultation meetings with their instructors individually or in groups. They have to report the status of the visit and the difficulties encountered to the instructors to help them to understand the needs of the students and make corresponding adjustments.\n\n\t(4) Field visit: The staff members of the elderly centre would leads the students to enter the community to gain insight into the local community culture and history.\n\n\t(5) Results sharing: This includes class discussion and sharing, sharing of results and some follow-up activities. In the classroom discussion and sharing, everyone will study the difficulties and value in the service-learning process; in the results sharing session, the elderly, center staff and colleagues in service-learning will be invited, and the instructors will listen to the students' report on the learning results, and give comments ; and in the follow-up activities, that is, after the book about 'personal interview' has been compiled, the results of service-learning will be shared and passed on to the public in press conferences, exhibitions and other activities."

At the beginning, many elders would say, “I am old. There is nothing special in life and nothing special to be interviewed.” However, during the interview, the students’ attention to and affirmation of the experiences of the elders could help them enhance their confidence and re-examine the value and meaning of their life.\n\nDr. Siu believes that people who do not necessarily do great things to be heroes, as long as they live wonderfully, they are heroes.

Problems arise, mostly because the students lacked preparation before the interview, or the publicity and coordination work of the partner organization was not good enough.\n\n<i>Preparatory workshops</i>\n\nIn the early stage of the course, there were two workshops about “communication skills” and “Hong Kong culture”. Colleagues from OSL would explain the concepts of service-learning and interview methods at the first workshop. In addition, staff of the elderly center would be invited to introduce the service targets and the skills of getting along with the elderly.

Third, the students would reflect fully during the results sharing session and to rethink their relationship with the elderly.\n\nIn the early stage of the course, students can choose to participate in the service-learning part or non-service-learning part of 'news writing'. In the service-learning part, fixed interview subjects and themes had been set up, namely, the elderly in Hung Shui Kiu and 'Hong Kong in 1950'. In the non-service-learning part, there was no rigidly designated interview subject. The participating students could choose the interview subject and writing theme by themselves. In addition, there were specific requirements for the number of consultation meetings for service-learning students, but not for non-service-learning students. Dr. Siu explained that the reason for setting up this requirement was that students were not familiar with the elders and the interview difficulty was relatively high. The three consultations were required to ensure the support of the instructors to the students and the quality of the course. For students who participate in non-service-learning part, most of them would find people whom they knew well or friends as interview subjects, so the interview arrangement was relatively easy.

However, some colleagues also reported that it was extremely unpleasant to cooperate with the institution and the elderly. Therefore, the instructors and the representative of the partner institution should have a good communication before the operation of the service-learning project.\n\n<i>Cooperation with other universities</i>\n\nDr. Siu had collaborated with the School of Chinese Medicine of the Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) in a service-learning course, combining 'personal interviews' with 'Chinese medicine diet'. This joint effort allowed students of LU to be responsible for interviewing the elderly and students of HKBU could then provide dietary treatment plan based on interview content. However, there were some challenges in this process:\n\n\t(1) The setting of the curriculum separated the content that the students of the two universities were responsible for. Specifically, there was little overlap in the content of the responsibilities of the students of the two universities, resulting in less communication between the two parties, and there was no exchange of interview knowledge and Chinese medicine knowledge. The measure taken by Dr. Siu was to add additional workshops to give Lingnan students the opportunity to learn more about Chinese medicine.\n\t(2) The schedule of the two universities needed to be adjusted.

This was a separate project with no credit requirements. Students who had participated in 'news writing' service-learning would be recruited. According to Dr. Siu’s observation, students were more open to non-credit projects than courses with credit requirements. Specifically, in credit courses, homework is linked to scores and many of the students' considerations will be about test scores, such as the accuracy of words used and the level of detail in descriptions. The advantage of this is that they can well constrain and regulate their own output, but the disadvantage is that the choice of topics and the use of sentences will be more conservative, with fewer breakthroughs and innovations. In a separate project, students would have a more personal style of using sentences, and the choice of topics was also related to their interests. Taking the latter as an example, upon the students’ arrival in Taiwan, they chose various topics, such as the reconstruction of Taipei Twin Island, community pollution or transportation.\n\nIn addition, in Taiwan, the time period for individual projects was short and services were more concentrated. In a relatively unfamiliar and isolated environment, students could be more engaged. In Hong Kong, the student engagement and concentration were often disturbed by various other affairs, such as other courses, meetings, and other homework."

In 2016, the previous course instructor asked if Dr. Lam was interested in leading this course and he has officially been responsible for the course ITC2S01 from then on. There was only one service-learning course at their department at that time. To increase the number of service-learning courses, Dr. Lam revised the course ITC2S01 and added other elements to create another course ITC2S02. In 2017, the course ITC2S02 began. According to Dr. Lam, one major difference between the two courses is that ITC2S01 mainly involves conducting service for the disabled while course ITC2S02 aims at conducting service with the service recipients through a co-design process.\nFrom her observation since 2015, Dr. Lam realized that many service-recipients, in the service activities, tended to act like making orders to the students, such as asking students to make clothes or a dress. It seemed that students were there to serve the disabled. Dr. Lam commented that both parties should benefit from the service-learning process and encouraged each other. The co-design process allowed the service recipients to get involved. With some guidance, the service-recipients could put some efforts in the activities within their capabilities. For instance, if the service recipients were good at drawing, they could draw some pictures on the cloth with which the students could use to make clothes. “The rationale for the co-design process was to encourage interaction between the students and the service recipients,” Dr. Lam said. For instance, students could talk with the service recipients about their hobbies. The students could then talk about stories through the clothes. Dr. Lam said that the main character of the course was not just about the product but more like expressing the thoughts of the service recipients.\nThere had been big changes since the past 5 years. According to Dr. Lam, many NGO partners gave positive feedback that many service recipients felt being respected from the co- design process as they never thought that they could successfully make their own clothes."

Through lectures, the course instructor would convey the knowledge and skills specific to the practice of expressive textile arts in the semester two. Dr. Lam would show students some literature and explain academically how the interventions involving expressive textile arts would benefit different service recipients. Moreover, students would also understand the rationales behind the concepts and their functions.\nAfter the students have acquired some basic concepts, they will be engaged in the service- learning project to develop their practical skills together with the service recipients, who are people with special needs, such as underprivileged children and women, single parents, ex- mentally ill persons, etc. All the artworks from the co-design process would be recorded. Given that service recipients need to get involved in the co-designing process, the service- learning project is arranged to start in semester three from the mid of May to July. In the one and half months, students would spend 40 hours in 5 weeks in direct contact with the recipients. The service recipients would be invited to take the course.\nA styling presentation with photo-shooting sessions were conducted as part of the service rendering and the service recipients modeled their own expressive textile artworks during the presentation. Specifically, the photo records of artworks and the actual artworks developed were jointly presented in a mini fashion show. In the mini fashion show, the local service recipients modeled their own expressive textile artworks with their personal expressions."

She had 8 staff to observe the students on-site and to do assessment. For instance, these teaching assistants recorded students’ punctuality, absenteeism and their preparation.

The NGO wrote down some taboos related to each service recipient and distributed to students according to service recipients they took care of. During the seminar, there would be some warm-up activities, such as making introductions or playing games.\nAfter introduction, the social workers would take the service recipients to another room to rest and then guided the students to tour around the NGO. Another social worker would start the sharing section. Dr. Lam stated that it was very important for the NGO to share the interpersonal skills. For instance, in the third year of operating this service-learning course, there were 10 mentally retarded people involved in the program and they were different from the other normal mentally ill people as they did not know how to express with words. It was a huge challenge for the students.\nTo involve those service recipients in the co-design process, the NGO suggested students to use leading method, instead of commending, in the co-design process. One 70-year-old woman suffering from severe mental retardation impressed Dr. Lam the most. This elderly did not have long span of attention that she would take a nap every 15 minutes. Therefore, students needed to be very patient. Using the leading method, the students cut some flowers for the elderly and then the elderly would use a sponge roller to print out the flower. Although printing with shaky hands, the elderly enjoyed this process a lot that she immediately wrapped the cloth around her neck as if it was a scarf. Seeing this scene, students believed that although the elderly could not express, she could show her emotions through action. This new way of expression was also very novel to students."

This course was offered by Dr. Chan Hin Wang Kevin, he is from the department of Applied Social Sciences of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nThe course Community Psychology started from 2011. At that time, the course was run as a pilot service-learning course for the three-year curriculum students as a general education elective. The reason for constructing it as a service-learning module was that Dr. Chan wanted to use the service-learning pedagogy to serve the course purpose. Specifically, the course required students to not only learn theory and knowledge about how people behave in a community, but also take corresponding actions to change the community. Only through a service-learning module can students fully grasp the community psychology properly. The pilot service-learning course had attained positive achievement. Therefore, this course commenced as a subject of the four-year curriculum. Later, it has been categorized as one of the service-learning subjects and the course has been offered to the students who take this four-year new curriculum, contributing to their achieving the general university requirements, which involve thirty credits of the class subject to service learning, the interpersonal leadership and etc.\n\nCommunity Psychology includes three modules of learning: Lectures/workshops, e-learning and first-hand community service. It was a small class size enrolled with 24-40 university students.\n\n\ta. Lectures/workshops are designed to equip students with the discipline-specific knowledge, including health promotion and prevention, empowerment, and sense of community and social capital. Some intervention targeting at community health, individual’s wellness and civic society at higher level will also be introduced.\n\tb. Students need to attend 10-hour e-learning module developed and delivered by the Office of Service Learning at PolyU, which aims to introduce basic concepts and practice of service-learning. Students are required to complete the e-learning module within the first four weeks of the semester.\n\tc. For gaining the first-hand community service experience, students can participate in either a health promotion or a child development program. Within the program, the students are expected to work closely with the collaborative agency to deliver a range of tasks and activities to the service recipients. The students would be divided into teams of around five persons. Each team are required to participate in home visitation, specific tasks assigned by the service agency and design activity according to the community and service needs."

Through home visitation, students would be exposed to and get to know about the community. For example, going through home visitation routine allows students to get first-hand experience about what a unit in an old building estate looks like; what does a singleton elderly home look like; what does a two senior couple only with one domestic helper look like; what it was like to step into a home of an ethnic minority.\n\nFor the second section, university students would be helping out some community activities organized by the service partner, such as a community health fair, or the seniors-organized or senior-let activities on recreational exercise. Being a passive role in those activities allows students to reflect on their role and responsibilities both as a professional in their chosen discipline and as a responsible citizen.\n\nFor the third section, students needed to design one activity for the seniors, which would be on the need or topic that the seniors wanted the most. Students could choose whatever format or style they wanted for the activity. They had to plan the activities. Usually, the course teacher would give them a list of hot topics or prioritized needs in the community.

Take PolyU students as an example, they would have a lot of commitments, such as doing part-time jobs, and preparing quizzes on Saturdays. With students having heavy schedule at school (university), course leaders should set different and diverse spectrum of community services with varying degrees of skills and time commitment required for students to have the flexibility to choose the timeslot according to their timetable.\n\nNevertheless, Dr. Chan put forward that there must be a good balance between enough diversity and unified and feasible service offering for the students. He added that too much diversity would not only drain students’ energy, but also the teaching team, the service NGO and the recipients. Therefore, striking a balance, such as having a personalized or tailored service packages, would save a lot of financial and time resources from the NGO as well as time from the recipients."

Also, there were some awkward cases, for example, a group of all female members knocked on the door and saw a 70-year-old man dressed in only a pair of underpants.\n\nSocial workers, Dr. Chan and students would also discuss together and come up with some solutions to prevent or solve such problems.

Different from other service-learning courses, his course involves assessment from multiple assessors. That is, both course lecturer and on-site supervisors would assess students. In order to maintain the consistency among different assessors, he requires assessors to grade students based on the rubric. The service rubric has clearly outlined several key components, such as professionalism, punctuality, commitment to the community service and to what extent they would exhibit their sincere concern on the service recipients. Dr. Chan would give students brief descriptions on each service assessment as well as the requirement of other assessment forms, such as reflective journal and paper assessment.\n\nFor individual performance, Dr. Chan could assess students from their reflective journals or essays submitted after the service-learning activities. The reasons of collecting their reflective journals or essays were to know how well students blended theories learnt in class coverage of subject matter and practice in their community service-learning experience. Quizzes were set as part of the course work, aiming at consolidating students’ comprehension of the essential and content knowledge blocks in the respective units. The questions were based on the weekly required reading and the lecture. Students were required to attend a number sessions of e-learning module developed and delivered by the Office of Service-Learning in PolyU to learn basic concepts and practice of service-learning.\n\nAnother issue is that with diverse portfolio of tasks, students’ satisfaction could be easily achieved. For example, some students might be very enthusiastic but they only have limited effort to invest time in a task due to their heavy workload at school. In this case, course teachers should set up a diverse portfolio of task that students at varying levels of competence can somehow meet the requirements of the tasks and get satisfaction and sense of competence after accomplishing the tasks"

He could obtain a certain amount of budget from his department to afford the junior teaching staff. However, he mentioned that when incorporating more senior staff, he had to design and plan his budget carefully to make sure that the senior staff’s involvement was on the point and constrained to an affordable budget. The key was to balance the budget and investment of the time and effort of the particular senior staff wisely on the overall cost preparation."

            text: "Apart from involving senior teaching staff, Dr. Chan also worked with the local senior volunteers in this service-learning project. They mainly helped to lead and moderate the home visitation for the university students. There are several advantages of such pairing arrangement. Firstly, the senior volunteers were more familiar with the service recipients. There would be higher possibilities that the service recipients would let the university students in for the visitation. Secondly, university students could take this chance to observe how local senior volunteers started the conversation with the elderly, so as to appreciate the social cohesion, and to strengthen their application of developmental theories that had been taught in the class to their adaptation in the home visits."

        content: "For Dr. Chan, the main challenge was that for students from the social work profession, it was relatively difficult for them to pick up the services. They had higher anxiety and challenge in differentiating community service from their own professional practice. Some of them would undermine the service and think that the community service was too easy for them while others would raise the bar of excellence so high that they became too demanding on themselves as well as the service NGO.\n\nFor students who set higher bar for their performance, Dr. Chan attempted to solve the problem by re-emphasizing to the students that this was not a social work practicum, but a community service. He tried to tell the students to set lower requirement because it was unreasonable to have high demand on students who were not registered social workers."
