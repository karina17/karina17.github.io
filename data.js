          "Case 1 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled “Promotion of Children and Adolescent Development” (Hereinafter referred to as Children). This course was offered by Dr. YU Lu, she is from the department of Applied Social Sciences of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nThe course expects students to be able to 1) critically examine the different perspectives of child and adolescent development and apply the concepts in understanding the needs and potentials of underprivileged children and adolescents in the community, 2) integrate knowledge on child and adolescent development into real life situations through service delivery, 3) apply the discipline specific knowledge and skills (such as engagement and communication skills with children and adolescents) to deal with complex issues in the service setting, 4) reflect on their roles and responsibilities both as a professional in their chosen discipline and as a responsible citizen, 5) cultivate the positive values and strengths orientation, 6) cultivate civic responsibilities and prosocial behaviors, 7) develop the sense of care and compassion towards other people, especially the underprivileged children and adolescents in the community, 8) enhance self-confidence, problem solving and decision-making capabilities, 9) enhance the social competence and interpersonal skills through collaboration with the partners, partnered agencies, parents and service targets.\n\nThe course Children runs across two semesters - spring semester and summer semester. In the spring semester, students were required to complete a 10-hour online course on basic concepts and practice of service-learning, such as principles, concepts and research of service-learning), benefits of service-learning to the service users, the community, the students and the university, the ethical issues, effective teamwork and problem solving skills in service-learning, reflection as a tool for learning discipline-specific concepts.\n\nIn the spring semester, the course also included one lesson on the course content and three lessons on theories related to the development of children and adolescents. Each lesson lasted for three hours, including 1) lectures and seminars for acquiring discipline-specific knowledge, including developmental theories of child and adolescent development, ecological model of human development, positive youth development model, the strengths model of intervention, 3) seminars for equipping themselves with the project-specific skills such as engagement and communication skills of children and adolescents, ways to promote their competence, assessment of child and adolescent development, generic service planning, delivery and evaluation etc., 4) small group discussion and workshops for students to develop a service curriculum for the underprivileged children and adolescents, to share moral and ethical issues, service delivery skills and classroom management and through which students develop their teamwork capability. At the workshops about service activities, the course instructors guided the university students as to how to design instructional programs and to acquire basic teaching skills. For example, there would be lesson on how to stimulate primary school students’ interest and motivation in learning and on strategies to engage them in classroom learning. The university students were free to choose specific teaching topics based on their experiences and interests.\n\nAfter that, they joined a 10-day tour and complete a service-learning project in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xi’an in Mainland China. During these ten days’ period, they have preparations before service in the first two days, and then the service activities were held in a primary school in the next five days. The day after the service activities, the course instructors organized the sixth workshop to help students consolidate what they had learned. Upon returning to Hong Kong, the students were also required to have a group presentation at their final workshop."

              "For running this Children course, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) cooperated with Zhejiang University in Mainland China to launch the service activities in a primary school in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. The primary school was set up by the local government mainly for the migrant children who were born elsewhere in China and their parents were working in Hangzhou.\n\nThe students from the PolyU who took the Children course traveled to Hangzhou during the summer semester and provided a five-day service in the primary school. They were mainly engaged in teaching activities for the primary school students. During the service period, the research students of Zhejiang University participated in classroom observation and group discussions after class, and shared their observations and opinions.\n\nThis Children course emphasized rich and effective communication with the service partner. The counterparts of Zhejiang University initially made contact with the primary school. After the clarifications of the cooperation intention and before meeting directly with partners in the primary school, the course instructors sent the service plan to the school principal for advice and suggestions. The service plan covered:\n- What did the PolyU plan to do?\n- Whether the expectations and proposed service arrangement of the PolyU were reasonable?\n- In the opinion of the primary school, was it appropriate to do so?\n- Could it be achieved in the current school environment?\n- What were the expectations of the primary school from PolyU and Zhejiang University, for example, about the topics and content that would be taught by the university students?\n\nThe course instructors asked the opinions of the school partners about the following four themes: interesting science, health promotion, personal development, interesting daily English and their expectations on the theme-related contents and their corresponding proportions, and then made revisions accordingly. After reviewing the service plan, the school partners accepted and recognized the concept of service-learning, and expressed confidence in the enthusiasm and attitude of the university students. Through this active communication, the school partners felt being respected. With a good understanding of the service details and with their opinions being addressed, the partners would be more willing to cooperate.\n\nDuring the service period, the collaborating parties had to handle conflicts and keep maintaining a good understanding of each other. The PolyU hoped that the university students could play a leading role in class management. At the beginning, the head teachers worried that the university students could not manage the class effectively, so they often entered the classrooms to intervene the class activities and to discipline the school children. It was found that whenever the head teachers appeared, the school children would follow directly the instructions of them, and the performance of university students was hence restricted. During the learning process, the head teachers thought that the class was too messy while the university students regarded that the head teachers were too strict.\n\nTo enhance mutual understanding, the course instructors of PolyU invited the head teachers to participate in the reflective meeting every afternoon to share their observations and concerns. The university students would also explain to the head teachers their interactive teaching methods and their views on the noisy class. Gradually, with more understanding, the head teachers finally intervened less in the following year. During the preparation stage, the course instructors also guided the university students to understand the cultural differences between the two places and expected them to try their best to seek the help of the head teachers so that their service activities could be completed at the scheduled service period.\n\nAt the beginning of the third year, the collaboration became smooth. The head teachers finally showed their confidence in the university students and they did not observe the class teaching daily. Instead, they would meet the university students first to introduce the class information as well as the characteristics of the primary school students. The university students could also easily make contact with them in their office in case of need. There would be regular reflective meetings at the end of the service day. The collaboration model between the two parties was finally well established after this active communication and mutual adjustment process.\n\nWhen the service period of the year ended, the PolyU and the service partners in China maintained their contacts with each other through different means.\n\n<b><i>Sharing students’ learning outcomes.</i></b> The primary school invited a local TV station to film a graduation ceremony at the end of the service period and had it broadcasted as news. The school shared the information with the course instructors of PolyU and the information could be used in teaching in the coming year. The PolyU also shared with the school the videos and photos taken during the service period, which were about progress and outcomes of the teaching activities as well as the reflective meetings.\n\n<b><i>Invitation to conference.</i></b> When a paper, based on the data collected for this service-learning course in the first year of collaboration, was written by the course instructors of the PolyU and was accepted for presentation at a conference, the service partners were also invited to attend the conference. This helped to improve mutual understanding and contact between them.\n\n<b><i>Establish personal relationship.</i></b> At the same time, some personal relationships were also developed and they would update each other. A trusting collaborating relationship was gradually established and sustained among the service partners."

            text:
              "In the first year, about 40 students from the PolyU participated in the Children course. Two course instructors jointly led the university students to Hangzhou. As a result, with the positive learning experiences and outcomes of students, the primary school expected that the PolyU would continue to provide service activities in the second year and was willing to develop a long-term cooperative partnership. Therefore, the PolyU organized two classes with about 80 students in the following year. In addition, there were two more course instructors and one project assistant. Finally, a total of 5 colleagues (4 course instructors and 1 project assistant) led about 80 university students to Hangzhou. The four course instructors provided guidance to the university students while the project assistant was responsible for handling administrative matters. The university students formed teams of 4 and 5 students each and each team would serve about twenty primary school students. The number of primary school students in the school also increased from around 200 in the first year to around 400.\n\nThe increase of the class size brought new challenges to the collaborating parties. The primary school required more support, for example, in handling meals and maintaining the hygiene conditions. At the same time, there were problems to resolve. When the primary school students faced problems, they would normally approach the school principal or head teachers for help instead of discussing with the university students there in the class first. For example, for late delivery of lunch boxes to a class while the students from other classes had already started eating, some school students would cry and go to find the principal directly.\n\nThe increase in class size also caused more accidents. The course instructors also encountered problems. On one occasion, one of them had an urgent health issue and had to go back to Hong Kong early. The course instructors had to deal with the manpower allocation among them timely at that time. Thereafter, the class size was maintained to be 80 and in two large classes. The two large classes formed 4 small groups of 20 students each. This 20 students’ group size was more suitable for a course instructor to observe and supervise."

          "At the time of design, the course instructor of Children paid close attention to the students’ opportunities to apply their knowledge acquired during lessons in the service activities arranged for the service targets. If the two (curriculum and services) are out of touch of each other, the students would think that the previous learning in lessons was useless and the service activities were no different from ordinary volunteer activities.\n\nTo enhance the linkage between the curriculum and the services, the course instructors would introduce the characteristics of children and adolescents at their different stages of development in the spring semester. Students would also have the opportunity to develop appropriate teaching topics for the group’s teaching plan with the background theories they acquired during the lessons. For example, when the university students obtained the knowledge from the lectures that the children of middle childhood would be prone to accidents and in the choice of “health promotion” as the theme, the university students specifically chose the ‘Furniture Safety’ as the teaching topic so as to help school children to better protect themselves at home.\n\nAnother objective of the course is to develop students' teamwork abilities. Therefore, in the service activities, the university students formed into different groups, and each group would lead the service activities for 20 primary school students. There would be a team leader each time with the support of other student members of the team in guiding the children to participate in discussions and activities and in this regard, it was expected to enhance the university students’ abilities in teamwork, collaboration and communication.\n\nIn addition to the design phase, after the end of daily service activities, the course instructors also attached great importance to how to connect with the course content when leading reflection and discussion. The university students would be guided to respect the individual differences and diversity of children. In their practical teaching process, the students often encountered the different learning performances of children. For example, when learning English, some primary school children showed a high standard, but some only reached the entry level. The course instructors would provide specific advice on how to design tiered learning tasks and different levels of worksheet based on students’ abilities, and provide students with different scaffolding. At the same time, the instructors guided university students to understand the individual differences and diversity in the growth of children and adolescents and to take care of the diversity of children in the course of service activities."

During the service time, the university students would encounter primary school children who needed special care. Therefore, when meeting the head teachers, the university students would emphasize the understanding of those children who needed special attention and how to deal with them\n\nIn addition to the understanding of the characteristics of the students before the start of the formal service activities, the course instructors also paid great attention to analyzing the characteristics and behaviors of the school students together with the university students in the daily reflective activities, especially about the school students who acted with rebellious behaviors, they would explore the causes of such behaviors, how their negative emotions were generated, and so on. This was very helpful for university students to deepen their understanding of the characteristics of primary school students."

With direct interactions with the school children, the university students were expected to develop their passion of caring towards the children and showed their empathy. For example, a girl in Dr. Yu’s class transformed herself from a girl who disliked children to one who would like to help them. She later joined a tour to Africa to help more children. She found that children were sincere though sometimes annoying."

For example, the course instructors had designed for lecture themes on interesting science, health promotion, personal development and interesting daily English. The university students could select their teaching topics from the four themes based on their own experiences and interests. The instructors would encourage students to select those themes related to their major study. For example, students whose major was in marketing and finance could choose to teach the primary school children how to manage their pocket money. Meanwhile, the instructors would organize workshops and helped the students to equip with teaching skills, such as how to engage primary school students in activities and how to improve their learning motivation.\n\nThe university students would also discuss with the instructors their lesson plans. With the guidance of the instructors, the students would adjust their teaching plans taking into consideration the development level of the primary school students and the different learning context of Mainland China.\n\nAfter the completion of writing a teaching plan, the university students would discuss with the instructors how much the plan was suitable for the development level of the primary school students and whether the content was suitable for presentation in the context of the Mainland China. For example, the Children class will cover knowledge about physical development. Based on the learning need of the upper primary school students, the university students plan to explore topics about sex education. The instructors then explained to the university students about the social background of Mainland China, the general views of people on sex education, and suggested the extent that it could be talked about. With the feedback from the instructors, the students would revise their teaching plans. In this process, the instructors would provide guidance only and would not revise the lesson plans for the students directly"

Before the service activities, the instructors will introduce the theories and the students will have self-reflections on their personal growth experience. In the workshops, the instructors will guide students to apply skills acquired in lessons in classroom management as well as drawing the attention of participants in class. The instructors will present specific situations and questions and help students to learn through case study in which the students discuss for solutions to problematic situations. The instructors observe that after continuous reflection activities, students would use what they have learned to analyze problems and reflect on their personal learning in the process of offering service.\n\nDuring the service activities in Hangzhou, the course instructors, students from PolyU and Zhejiang University participated in reflection meetings at the end of daily activities, and the primary school teachers would sometimes participate. The students were more willing to share true feelings and reflect on themselves in a learning environment where there were sincere expression, mutual trust, supportive and safe atmosphere. Each student would talk about their teaching process in class and reflect on their own performance and difficulties at the service activities. They also shared how to get along with the children. In addition to the positive learning, all parties involved would also share their weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n\nIn the reflection meetings, the research students from Zhejiang University acted as observers and they would share what they had seen at the teaching sessions. With reference to how the university students took care of different physical and psychological needs of the school children, the course instructors designed a classroom observation sheet. Prior to taking up their observation role, they would be required to attend a workshop on how to use the observations sheet, about the principles of recording, and about how to give positive encouragement and constructive opinions when making comments on students’ performance. Although the results would not be taken into account as assessment scores, the use of observation sheet can help students structure their observation content, follow the proper observation principles, give helpful opinions and suggestions during the reflection meeting. The course instructors find that the comments are very helpful for the improvement in the teaching process and therefore, accordingly, students can usually make timely adjustment in the coming service sessions.\n\nTo overcome the challenges and difficulties raised by the students and the observers, the instructors would provide timely feedback and suggestions, for example, on how to talk with and get along with the children. For problems which cannot be resolved immediately, the students will be provided with some principles to understand the problems at that time. When some individual students have emotional issue, the instructors would follow up and offer personal support. For example, the PolyU students pointed out the variations in the educational methods between Mainland China and Hong Kong as teachers in China put emphasis on students’ disciplines in class and had strict rules. Accordingly, the PolyU students would express their views and discuss how to use interactive methods during the lessons."

              "Service-learning is different from traditional teaching. This requires the instructor to recognize the concept of service-learning and to believe that it can have a positive impact on students’ learning. It also requires the instructor to have a concrete and thorough understanding of the characteristics of service-learning. In addition, the subject instructors also need to invest more time and energy to deal with matters related to other stakeholders, for example, students and other service partners. The course instructors also need to provide students additional guidance to the design and running of service plans with the service partners and recipients. Therefore, the course instructors also need to spend time on understanding thoroughly the expectations and needs of the service partners.\n\nFor Children course, at the preparation stage prior to the service activities, the course instructors provided guidance and support to students, which included the guidance about the design of the teaching plans. For example, the course instructors would advise to adjust the level of content difficulty when it was found that the primary school students might find it hard to understand. The course instructors would also advise whether the selected topic was suitable for Mainland students, and would give suggestions how the university students could revise the plan according to the background and context of the primary school. For example, a group of students designed topics related to sex education. The course instructors would explain the differences between the mainland and Hong Kong regarding the physical health and sex education for primary school students, and would advise the university students how to revise the teaching plans and methods. With reference to the instructor's opinions, the students revised their teaching plans.\n\nFor another example, the Children course focused on promoting positive youth development. Understanding and respecting the diversity of students is one of the important principles. In the process of instructing university students to design teaching plans and in their teaching practice, the course instructors paid much attention to guiding university students to take care of the diversity of students. If some students did not keep up with the progress, the instructors would make specific suggestions on how to set up layered content and coursework. In the implementation process, the diversity of school children was also taken into consideration, and different kinds of support and help would be provided to the children with respect to their differences in their participation in activities.\n\nWhen the service activities formally begin, the university students will encounter some unforeseen challenges and their emotions will fluctuate. The course instructors would pay great attention to provide emotional support to students. They would observe the performance and improvement of university students in their attitudes, engagement levels, and caring of students. The instructors would recognize the strengths of students and proposed improvement suggestions. The instructors observed that when university students were positively encouraged, they were often more willing to take the initiative to improve the teaching plans and considered multiple strategies to improve the learning effectiveness of primary school students. For example, on the first day of teaching, usually everyone was frustrated. The instructor would focus on giving emotional support to university students, telling them that the performance on the first day was not the most important. The instructors was more concerned with the time and energy the university students had put in the whole service, their attitude towards service activities, their caring of the primary school students, and the improvement of the university students in the process. The instructors recognized the strengths of the university students and pointed out their areas for improvement. This encouraged the university students to be willing to take the initiative to change themselves, revise their plans, and consider using various strategies to get along with the primary school students.\n\nIn addition, for service activities to be conducted well, it depends very much on good a collaborative relationship between the university and the community. The performance of university students in service activities has become a critical factor for the establishment of this relationship and therefore, the instructors will pay more attention to the performance of university students. As a compulsory course for all undergraduate students, the participating students’ are having diverse backgrounds and learning motives. For example, some university students were less participative at the beginning of the course and they just wanted to meet basic course requirements. With regard to past experience, when university students were in direct contact with primary school students, they often changed their views on service activities. Therefore, the course instructors would be attentive in provision of timely and relevant guidance to guide students to understand the meaning and functions of service activities. The good news is that the learning motives of university students will often be positively cultivated in this service-learning process."

In addition, the course instructors would also invite the principal of the primary school and the head teachers of each class to fill out a questionnaire to evaluate the performance of the students from the PolyU.\n\nIn addition to the questionnaire, the course instructors will review the effectiveness of the entire service activity with the principal and all the head teachers after each service event. According to the opinions of the principal and the teachers, the instructors will make adjustments in the teaching arrangements for the next year. For example, in the first year, a head teacher in charge of a class mentioned about health issues which would pose a safety hazard. Therefore, in the workshops held in the next year, the instructors increased the sanitation treatment in the class management, prompting the university students how to arrange student-on-duty daily and how to check the doors and windows. After making the corresponding adjustments, the primary school teachers felt very satisfied in the next year.\n\nThe course instructors also received feedback from other research projects. For example, another research team at the PolyU also visited the school of the Children course. Colleagues from the research team shared the results with the course instructors. The research team mentioned that some students mentioned that the 5-day service activities were always carried out in the school. It becomes a little bit boring, and the university students lack both the understanding of local culture and the opportunity of cultural exchange with local people. The course instructors listened to the opinion and made adjustments in the service arrangement for the next year, making 4 days as teaching days and 1 day as cultural day. In the morning of the cultural day, the university students of led the primary school students to visit a museum near the school, and they shared several topics in the afternoon, for example, the impressive things in the exhibition in the museum. The primary school students introduced the things that represent Hangzhou culture. The university students introduced the culture of their hometown. Both the students from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Zhejiang University students shared something about the cultures of their hometown. The primary school students brought something from home and explained it with their personal stories. This sharing activity allowed students of the PolyU to gain a rich understanding of primary school students and local culture within a short period of time."

          "It is a compulsory requirement for every student of the PolyU to complete a service-learning course which carries 3 credits. Although the students can have different choices, for those students with low interest in service-learning, their motivation and service performance will be unsatisfactory. From the experience of the course instructors, if the instructor can help some of these students to be properly prepared, give appropriate guidance in the process of learning and service, the students will learn and make a change. However, there are also some students who are more difficult to change. They always regard the service as an activity that they are forced to complete. They would only invest the least time and effort into it and it is difficult for teachers and students to communicate in depth.\n\nThe two-semester course schedule also has certain limitations too. Since some of the theories are taught in the spring semester, some of the content has been forgotten when students start to participate in the workshop during the summer. Therefore, some students suggest the arrangement of all the content to be taught before the summer semester."

            text: "Since 2008-2009, Dr. Law had been teaching the course called Art and Well Being (thereafter called Art). At the beginning, she strongly believed that experiential learning was crucial for students because the objective of the course was to discuss the influence of art on individuals or a group. She believed that if students could change others or even the whole community through the creation of art, such experience would certainly facilitate their deeper understanding of relevant theories. However, in the first year, Dr. Law was not familiar with the concept and practice of service-learning. She had no clear ideas of which organizations she could cooperate with and how the cooperation should be. Therefore, she kept adopting classroom teaching methods in class. During the first year of the course, Dr. Law began to communicate with colleagues from the Office of Service-Learning (OSL) at Lingnan University and learned the cooperation strategies with institutions and service-learning teaching practices.\n\nIn academic year 2009-2010, She attempted to incorporate the elements of service-learning into the Art course. 20 students took the course and among them, 8 students participated in service-learning activities. These students were divided into two teams, with four students each team, who provided service for mentally disabled adults and the South Asian children. She only arranged some students (8 out of 20) to participate in the service-learning activities because she would like to closely follow up the progress of the service-learning activities and to ensure the quality of the service. Since only some students participated in service-learning, these students did not need to join the school’s tutorial classes. Therefore, she made some adjustments to the course contents. For example, instead of teaching some concepts and theories in tutorials, she did it in lectures so that all the students could learn the key concepts. Since then, the number of students, who participated in service-learning activities, had been maintained between 4 and 10 each year. Although Dr. Law had attempted to require all 20 students to join the service-learning activities at one academic year since there were no other choices for the activities, she was very concerned that this “compulsory” requirement would affect students’ willingness and commitment of participation in service-learning.\n\nAt the first year (2009), students reported fruitful learning outcomes and that led Dr. Law to recognize the value of service-learning. Service-learning emphasizes mutual benefits and it can become a platform for inter-professional sharing. More importantly, Dr. Law finds that service- learning can help participating students to have changes. Through the students’ experience and reflective reports, she realized that the students had understood the expression power and good communication means of art. Some students had improved their social awareness and civic responsibilities during the process of helping a specific community group. They were not only concerned about their own affairs, but also cared more about the society and the community. Some students had changed their attitudes towards family members and ways of getting along with them. Moreover, their stereotypes towards social minorities had also been reduced. For instance, some students stated that they would pay more attention to the South Asians who passed by, imagining that the South Asians were born in Hong Kong and they were also willing to learn and respect their customs.\n\n\t“After checking students’ reflection and feedback, I have been totally committed.”\n\t“The feedback collected from the two groups of students has made me very touched and taught me what service-learning is.”\n\nSeveral years after, Dr. Law saw the long-term impact of this course on students’ career development. About 10% of the students who had taken the course had been involved in (or planned to) working for NGOs after graduation. Some of them worked as professional art clinicians. One student worked as a program manager in a nursing home. He called the nursing home an art home so as to enhance the life quality of the elderly. Other students also shared that they were inspired by the experience from service-learning and would like to have its applications in the future."

            header: "The course brief",
            text: "Referring to the course outline, the course Art “is designed to provide students with an introduction to the healing power of art. The concept of communicating personal ideas through art and of achieving a sense of well-being through artistic creation is not new, but the study and practice of using art and art-making as a form of healing have emerged only recently. Cross referencing findings of advanced modern sciences, theories of art and anthropology, the course investigates how artistic creation and general engagement with art can help people to gain an awareness of themselves and others, as well as to cope with symptoms, stress, and traumatic experiences. A Service Learning Research Scheme is incorporated if relevant services are available.”\n\nIn the classroom teaching, Dr. Law’s lecture included a few topics as follows: “Biological nature of art making; Art, sciences and the visual, Art and memory, Art and well-being, History of using art as therapy, Art and psychoanalysis, Art and education, Art and Symbols, Art therapy and art facilitation.”\n\nTo well prepare students for their learning in the service-based activities, Dr. Law believes that it is helpful to set up workshops or sharing sessions with alumni for university students to understand service-learning more before the service activities. These include:\n\n\t- Service learning is not just about giving to others, but learning to gain and enjoy in the process.\n\t- Students can eliminate common misunderstandings about service-learning, which are about that service-learning is equivalent to volunteering or students would have the sense of superiority in the service process.\n\t- Those non-voluntary students in participating in the service activities can then recognize the unique learning experiences from service-learning.\n\t- Students should also plan for their future activities based on their expertise.\n\nThe pre-service training is also helpful for students to have psychological preparation and to understand the importance of devoting love in service activities. Apart from the preparatory activities arranged by Dr. Law and the art facilitator, the OSL of LU also provides lectures and consultations to help students understand the meaning of service-learning.\n\nIn addition, during the design and preparation of the service activities, Dr. Law would prompt students to prepare alternative plans to deal with possible emergencies. For instance, for students who provided service for the South Asian children, their first workshop was for the 10-year-old children, but it turned out that there were three more kindergarten children who participated. The actual number of participants might also be uncertain. For instance, there might be 20 participants this time, but the number of participants might be reduced to 3 the next time. After the first workshop, the university students would prepare 2 plans according to the situation they could realize. For example, if both older and younger children showed up, university students would put a large piece of paper on the table and the children could stand around the table. The university students would tell the children that each person had to create a painting related to the theme of jungle within their own capabilities. Children painted anything and university students did not need to correct them but they came to understand this group of children that some liked McDonald’s while others liked whales."

      partnership: {
        content: "Dr. Law knew more about the potential organizations to cooperate with through the OSL at Lingnan University and with the assistance of the colleagues in the office, she began to work with two organizations. Since then, she would communicate with the collaborating partners prior to planning for the service-learning activities. She also tried to meet the colleagues from the OSL to explore the possible cooperation with other suitable organizations.\n\nDr. Law would invite art facilitators to go to the organizations with her. The art facilitators were employed by Dr. Law for facilitating the learning of the students and they would provide guidance and support to the students during the service-learning activities. When meeting the partners of the organizations, both parties would share their expectations, the types of service activities that could be provided by the university students, and also about the characteristics of the service recipients. For instance, a centre in Tung Chung provided service for immigrants. The centre related the difficulty of the new immigrants in integration into the Hong Kong society due to their narrow scope of activities and certain discrimination from Hong Kong people. The centre expected university students to provide help to tackle this social issue. This group of university students then put more emphasis on facilitating new immigrants to express their emotions and life situation through a variety of art forms.\n\nAfter running the similar service activities for a period of time, Dr. Law then considered how to sustain and deepen this collaborating relationships. However, during the communication with the organization, there involved some uncertain factors, such as the change of the person- in-charge of the organization. For considering a long-term cooperation, like 3 years, of a project, the objectives of both collaborating parties could be different. It would not be only talking about the number of workshops to be provided for the service recipients, but to look for how they could have substantial change in the long run. This requires further and thorough communication with collaborating partners.\n\nWhen the Art course has been run for several years, the OSL understands more the characteristics of the curriculum and the service requirements of the course. When there are suitable organizations and service needs, they will actively contact Dr. Law to develop more diverse service activities. For example, a colleague from the OSL introduced Art course and its service activities to an organization which is providing service to teenagers. When university students completed the service activities, they were very impressed. When they met the younger teenagers who had gone astray, there was great impact on them. The students have enhanced their empathy and also their gratitude for their families as well as the school resources they have now. \n\n\t“Inter-professional sharing is often carried out during the cooperation with organizations. Both parties can benefit from it and everyone respects each other.”"

        content: "In the academic year 2019/2020, Dr. Law cooperated with the first two institutions which provided service for the disabled and the South Asian youth. For choosing the service recipients, she mainly considered the extent to which characteristics of the people being served matched with the content of the course. That is, after the completion of the service-learning process, the students should realize that they had applied the theory and knowledge learned to the real-life and this allowed them to understand the meaning of the theory.\n\nShe explained that the choice of serving the mentally disabled people was due to the fact that there was little knowledge of how to communicate with them in daily life. One of the learning points of the course is taking art as a platform for promoting communication and expression. Once you expressed and communicated, you got connected. For the choice of South Asian children as service recipients, it is because they do not understand English and Cantonese well enough to study and live in Hong Kong. Using art as a second language and universal language is another learning point in this course. She believes that art-related discipline itself is suitable for combining certain service activities because art is a good platform. Through art-related activities, participants will be delightful. Learning is also playing. During the process of playing, children and university students will establish close relationships, love and connect with each other."

      service: {
        content: "Through service activities, Dr. Law expected that students could understand how the course led individuals to appreciate and be thankful. Art is a platform to help people express themselves, communicate and connect with others. Most of the service activities arranged by Dr. Law were for the disabled, South Asians, and new immigrants. Direct connection with these people will allow students to realize the power of art. It is relatively difficult to communicate with the dementia, autistic and intellectual disabled people, but through face-to- face interaction, students’ overall perception of these people will change.\n\nFor instance, one student who did not engage in all aspects of the course at the beginning, reported a fruitful learning outcome after experiencing unique service activities. The group that this student joined was providing service to a group of severely disabled people who had been living in the hospital. These people had been in wheelchairs for a long time and many of them were unable to use language to express themselves. So there was a piece of paper in front of their chairs stating water, rice, toilet, clothes, cold or not and they could point to the words wherever they wanted to go. Their disability situation was severe to such degree. When university students met these intellectual disabled people, they realized that the originally planned activities could not be carried out. Group activities had been forced to change into one- to-one activities. During this process, the university students were touched by the impact of the same-age mentally handicapped people whom they took care of. It was hard for university students to imagine that some people had been in bed and wheelchair since birth. In the course of the service activities, a mentally handicapped girl was also touched and cried when completing the artistic activities with the university students. This was also because they were connected with each other and emotionally touched. Such emotional connection had also moved the university student. The student began to cherish what he had in his life, and therefore he treated his life and study seriously and considered studying psychology.\n\nWhen the recipients connected with them, the university students were also touched. For example, the service recipients would show reluctance when seeing the university students leave. Some people would ask, “You are not coming back? Please come back!” These simple and sincere expressions were very touching to university students. Some students stated that if they had time in the future, they would continue to be volunteers. Such service experience also allows university students to eliminate stereotypes of people with intellectual disabilities, and are thus willing to actively interact with them. University students can see the positive characteristics of people with intellectual disabilities. For example, although they have limited IQ, they are kind and do not deceive people. They would also like to express emotions directly, such as telling you whether they are happy or not. These are things that could not be taught in class and they are the reasons why Dr. Law insists on integrating service-learning.\n\nA student who provided service to some South Asian children mentioned that during the ice- breaking phase, university students played “passing the music boxes” with them. The rule of the game was that whoever had the music box had to tell where he was from. When the music box was passed to a university student, he said, “I am from Dongguan.” A Pakistani teenager asked, “Are you not born in Hong Kong?” This teenager realized that these university students were not Hong Kong local people. The idea that “we are not Hong Kong local people” resonated with these Pakistani teenagers and they began to share province in Pakistan they came from. University students realized that having a closer relationship with the South Asian people could help them integrate into the Hong Kong society. They also realized that the South Asians were not marginal ethnic minorities and many yellow-skinned locals also came from other countries.\n\n\t“I saw a lot of transformation, so this is why I devote in service-learning. I think these are things that students cannot get in the classroom. If they do not experience by themselves, they could not have deep understanding.”\n\nIn Art course, students designed and implemented art activities as a group. This arrangement allowed them to learn how to cooperate with each other and flexibly handle emergencies in service. The service recipients and the activities themselves also provided opportunities for university students to take on some specific tasks. For example, in the process of implementing workshops for the South Asian children, some South Asian children appeared to be overactive, or suddenly had aggressive behaviors or walked around back and forth. The university students quickly learned that there was a need for team members to communicate and deal with children alone. This experience made university students realize the importance of cooperation in the implementation of workshop activities. Although each person has a different role, these roles have to be reassigned any time when accidence occurs. The university students can learn the importance and pleasure of cooperation from such experience and some can gradually become good friends."

      reflection: {
        content: "In Art course, students who joined the service-learning were required to complete 6 to 8 service activities. Each activities lasted for 1 to 2 hours. After completing 2 to 3 times of the service activities, students had to return to the university to patriciate in group consultation to share the current status and problems of the service activities. Dr. Law focused on guiding students to think and link the service experience with the subject knowledge. She mentioned that it was very important to arrange consultation section at this time. Some students thought that service was to do volunteer work. Although they wrote down proposals, and there was also an artist to provide guidance, many students, after going to the field, were very confused that they did not know what they wanted or the plan was not feasible and they did not know how to follow up and handle it.\n\nAfter starting the service activity, students had to record what they had seen and their experience. For example, when students observed that a child was very naughty, they had to explain the naughty behaviors and language performance, such as kicking someone, swearing or crying after kicking someone. Before the implementation of the workshop, university students had to write an activity proposal. They had to carefully observe the service process. Within 15 minutes after the end of the daily activity, they had to have a one-the-spot record and reflection. When going for consultation, university students should consult Dr. Law with these contents.\n\nThe consulting activities should help students understand the meaning of the service and learning. Most students, after talking to the teachers, started to understand what they were doing and they should do. For instance, some students tried to do art work but the service recipients did not respond or rarely participated, so the university students did not know how to deal with it. Dr. Law started from what the students did by asking students to think about what they really wanted to do and guided them to think about the differences between art and language. Art is visual language and it is about senses, instead of structural language. She further guided university students to understand how specific activities in the service could reflect art as a visual language to express senses and feelings. Then students began to focus on senses in the service activities. For example, they recorded a variety of voices, like birds singing, fireworks, etc. After listening to these sounds, the South Asians or the disabled needed to draw according to what they heard. During this process, it is important for the instructor to participate in the consulting activities because he/she is the person who is very familiar with the subject knowledge. This also requires instructors to invest in a lot of time and energy. For another example, a group of university students designed eight creative workshops for South Asian students in Sham Shui Po one year. At the first consultation, the students mentioned that he had not thought that some part of Hong Kong was very poor. Accordingly, students encountered a lot of challenges. For example, there was a situation that a sister wanted to bring her younger brother to join an activity. The students designed an activity for a 10-year-old child, but she brought along a 3-year-old brother. This became a challenge about how to arrange the activity for both a 10-year-old and a 3-year-old children at the same time. Additionally, because the classroom provided by the cooperative NGO was very small and the South Asian children were very excited. Moreover, some part of this room were in renovation, the artist was very concerned about the safety of the children. As the problem of the small space could not be solved, and the children became more and more active, changing the contents of the workshop was not feasible to solve the problem. Finally, after the end of the fourth course, the artist decided to cancel the remaining four workshops. The university students who participated in the service activities were very frustrated with this outcome and thought that their efforts were wasted. Dr. Law tried to guide students to learn from failure. Failure was also a kind of learning and she led students to think more about what had been learned in the process of designing and implementing four workshops.\n\nAnother example was related to the service activities for the South Asian children. In the discussion with the NGO, the NGO proposed to leave half an hour each time for themselves to arrange some specific activities. During the service activities, students found out that this half an hour was left for the South Asian children to complete the task of copying the Chinese characters. This had been in conflict with the principles designed by the university students of being spontaneous, joyful and self-directed. The South Asian children were not very interested in writing and even drew randomly. Dr. Law would advise students to have direct communication with the social workers in the institution and try to understand the purpose and objectives of this assignment. Dr. Law also asked university students to consider whether they were willing to teach the South Asian children to learn Chinese. She further gave specific suggestions, such as starting from the characteristics of the Chinese characters, their hieroglyphs and the phonographic structures, so as to help the South Asian children understand Chinese characters faster. If university students communicated with the social worker with sharing attitudes, they might obtain twice the result. As a result, after the communication, the social workers agreed that the university students could teach the next time. At the next-time activity, students were playing hieroglyphics for half an hour and they were very happy.\n\nDr. Law believes that maintaining flexibility during guidance has to make students realize that the key to the service is to understand the needs of the service recipients, rather than what the students think they can give or do for the service recipients. Therefore, students should listen to the needs and requirement of the service recipients and the service activities should meet their needs in certain aspects."

In the first time of service-learning, the students had to complete\n\n\t- 1 oral presentation by the group (other students needed to complete 2 times)\n\t- 1 reflection essay (other students did not need to do)\n\t- Final papers and examination (other students had the same requirement)\n\nSince students from the service-learning group reflected about the large amount of homework, Dr. Law revised the evaluation requirements in the following year. Students in the service- learning group could combine their final papers with the reflection essay. The articles must have references and relevant theories cited. Dr. Law explained that the reflective essay only required students to describe the status and reflection of the service activities, while the final paper was an academic paper, which had to include academic literature reference, analysis and discussion of relevant theories within the subject.\n\nThis was a course with three credits. Students were not just completing the service activities, but also needed to link theory with service activities so as to validate the theory and have deeper understanding of the social issues within the service activities. In fact, students accepted this requirement because this allowed students to have the opportunities to apply the theory learned in the classroom to explain the problems and phenomena encountered in service activities. Dr. Law observed that individual students who performed better in the service attempted to challenge the academic literature that they read. When students had specific experience, it was relatively easy for them to turn such experience into words."

            text: "Art facilitators mainly provided advice related to the status of the service at consultation and presentation and also provided feedback on students’ performance. Because the art facilitators would complete the service activities with the students at each course, the observation and evaluation from the art facilitor were very important. The art facilitfors would write down the observation and evaluations of each student in the service activities as references for Dr. Law’s assessment. The art facilitor did not simply give scores based on the evaluations, but had also needed to provide examples to justify the suggested scores.\n\nWhen students had group presentation, Dr. Law would also invite the colleagues form the organization to come and give advice on students’ performance and the issues discussed in the report. If time was permitted, she also hoped to receive the written records from the organization and their evaluation. The whole process also promoted mutual understanding between the organization and the students. For example, social workers were concerned about safety issues because university students had designed too many activities for children with hyperactivity whereas university students believed that it would be difficult to stimulate children’s inner self in a quiet state. In group presentation, university students had the opportunity to explain the rationales of the activities, and the social workers of the organization could also have the opportunity to express their concerns and also to explain reasons behind these concerns. As a result, the group presentation had been turned from an assessment and sharing section to an opportunity for dialogues for different parties.\n\nFrom teacher’s point of view, Dr. Law believes that providing feedback to students also needs flexibility. For instance, when listening to students’ demands, understanding their frustration and their observations, teachers should judge whether students’ observations are at the right direction according to each person’s situation, judge whether their complaints are reasonable, understand the emotions students experience during service and help them alleviate their negative emotions. Therefore, listening is equally important to teachers. Although teachers can prepare questions and points in advance, in the process of consultation and feedback, teachers should provide specific suggestions according to each students’ specific problems and difficulties. Dr. Law would keep asking students three questions: what is the goal of this workshop, what are you doing now and what your biggest problem is."

The facilitators would give advice and suggestions on service proposals prepared by students. Prior to commencement of the service activities, they would go to the community centre to understand the specific characteristics of the service recipients and to propose training and preparation required for the university students. For instance, introducing service recipients with intellectual disabilities who had symptoms of obsessive- compulsive disorder; helping university students to understand why they had these behaviors, and how to handle them, and as such, it was expected that university students’ tension and fear due to the lack of understanding could be alleviated. The role of facilitators was to motivate and inspire university students, rather than replacing university students to implement proposals or finish art workshops.\n\nThe art facilitator also worked with Dr. Law to communicate with the partner institution to understand its needs and the characteristics of the service recipients. The art facilitator would then understand when and how to provide students’ support, and how to help them understand the course, the expectation and requirements of the service. For example, university students might not be aware that their inadvertent speech might have brought discrimination against certain groups. Therefore, the art facilitator would help improve university students’ cross- cultural sensitivity and how to avoid harming others during communication.

For instance, there was an elderly, who was talking to a student, mentioned that all of her relatives had passed away and she was alone. She started crying. The students did not know how to handle in that situation at that moment. After the service time, the students contacted Dr. Law immediately. Dr. Law proposed the following handling approach:\n\n\t- Understand how the students handled the situation first.\n\t-Then she would lead students to think and reflect, such as why the elderly would burst into tears suddenly. With whom she would cry or not during interaction and why. Dr. Law thought that art was about feeling and there might be things in the activities that triggered the elderly’s deep emotions. When encountering such situation, Dr. Law provided guidance on handling, for example, should not let the student leave the centre with negative emotions.\n\t- Dr. Law then guided the students to identify solutions. She asked students to let the elderly describe her feelings and experiences, and then choose colors that could represent her feelings so as to help her release her negative emotions. When the elderly calmed down, she could be led to draw a picture to express the current situation.\n\t- After the communication with students, Dr. Law also called the social worker and informed him about the incident. She advised the social worker to pay more attention to the emotions of the elderly.\n\nDr. Law also coordinated and facilitated between the university students and the art facilitator. For instance, the expectation of the art facilitator for the student team who served the South Asian children was very high that he asked university students to modify their service proposals four times back and forth. The university students made revisions accordingly, but they did not understand the reasons for such repeated revisions. They even thought that the facilitator was too picky. When Dr. Law knew this specific situation, she found that the facilitator was asking the university students to pay more attention to the details of the service proposals, such as the size of the scissors and the type of the adhesive tape. She then explained to the students the reasons for considering the use of specific materials, the importance of developing the habits of being precise, and ways to understand and deal with different types of work and requirements. When university students realized the facilitator’s positive intention, the meticulous way of working and caring for students, they started to show appreciation for the facilitator’s character and serious attitude. Gradually, they became friends. Those were things that Dr. Law could not teach in class and that was a good learning experience for students."

For instance, students did not like painting and sometimes they did not know how to chat with the service recipients. They did not know how to arrange the activities for two hours at the service site. Dr. Law would emphasize that the focus of the service activities was not teaching new immigrants how to paint, but to help tem express their feelings and difficulties in life through the use of art. She would also advise other students to arrange activities that were easy to handle, such as manual work, hand-making beading, etc.\n\nHowever, Dr. Law believed that the main problem was whether students were interested in participating in the service activities. In this regard, she explained to students about the meaning of the service activities and asked students to contact the new immigrants to understand them more. She also encouraged students to get to know the new immigrants’ notions through art. For instance, many new immigrants linked their hometowns with the expression of artistic activities. They would come to know that their hearts were connected with their hometowns, especially among women and teenagers. It could be seen that some students were very touched and they made a change later.\n\nNevertheless, students’ motivation to learn is still a challenge that Dr. Law faces from time to time."

        content: "Case 3 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled “Motor Learning and Development” (Hereinafter referred to as Motor). This course was offered by Prof. Cheung Siu Yin, she is from Hong Kong Baptist University.\n\nProfessor Cheung has been teaching service learning for more than 10 years. The idea of teaching service learning came after attending a service learning workshop organized by a business school and when Professor Cheung began to understand the concept of service learning as well as how to provide new learning opportunities for students. Furthermore, she herself has been involved in many services and volunteer activities since childhood, thereby leading to a deep understanding of how to help people grow and change their perspectives through service learning.\n\nAt the initial stage, students who took the Motor Learning and Development course were from year three and year four levels at the university. There were about 30 students each class. The course was in the spring (second) semester of each academic year. For the first 6 years or so, Professor Cheung mainly worked with a kindergarten in Tai Po and a nearby elderly center. University students, thus, had the opportunities to compare the muscle development of both children and the elderly. Later, the curriculum was changed. Students who took the course were mainly freshmen and sophomores and the course started in the fall (first) semester. Such changes could not match with the timetable of the kindergarten and therefore, only the service activities of the elderly center were retained. The number of students enrolled in this course had increased to about 60. Students’ reflections and homework also focused on the physical fitness of the elderly."

Both parties, the hosting university and the service receiving institutions should discuss regularly how to benefit the service recipients and students so as to achieve a win-win situation. After many years’ cooperation with the elderly centre, the overall feedback was very good. The elderly all called Professor Cheung as Miss Cheung and with a good relationship established with the elderly, Professor Cheung felt very happy.\n\nIn the process of developing cooperative relations, an equal status had been fully reflected between the university students and the elderly, which benefited both parties. For the elderly, students from the Physical Education Department were very energetic that they led the elder people to exercise their limbs and taught them some motor skills. In the last part of the service, the elder people often came out to teach university students what they were good at. For example, a 90-year-old taught students Tai Chi, and the university students also appreciated the elderly, not just the attitude of serving others.\n\nProfessor Cheung is very familiar with the organization, thereby easy to communicate when encountering problems. For example, when the number of students enrolled in the course increased from 30 to 60, she actively discussed with the organization about adjusting the arrangement and the organization also shared their difficulties. The two parties held positive attitudes to solve problems. The communication with the kindergartens was also similar. The kindergarten activities were more of a large-scale that university students needed to serve hundreds of children. Before the event, the principal would be invited to Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) to watch videos of the previous events with the current university students and to get to know the preparations of the current events. After the establishment of an activity plan, one or two persons-in charge from the kindergarten would talk about and prepare for the implementation of the sports meeting with the university students. Face-to- face meetings and negotiations help both parties to understand the needs and solve problems in a timely manner. Professor Cheung mentioned that direct communication with kindergarten teachers was equally important. Discussion allowed kindergarten teachers to know the plans of the university students and the kindergarten teachers could give timely feedback as well."

It is very important for students to be able to apply the theory in service activities. The Motor course mainly focuses on how human muscles develop throughout life. \n\nIn addition to the content of the subject, Professor Cheung also strives to help students develop their generic skills through different types of activities. Teamwork is an ability that HKBU values and through group collaboration and oral presentations, students’ skills can be promoted and students can grow out of the challenges. For example, students had to complete an oral report within 5 minutes and it is to be a stress-coping exercise. Another example was that when team members had disputes and conflicts, Professor Cheung would meet with the whole team to discuss how to get along and cooperate with different people, how to adjust themselves, and how to assign roles and apply specific strategies in group work. As a facilitator, Professor Cheung would focus on how to help students learn and handle situation."

The service activities developed at that time mainly consisted of two parts. For the first part, it involved direct teaching to kindergarten children to develop fundamental motor skills. Through drawing lots, the second part was divided into locomotor skills (e.g. running around) and manipulation skills (e.g. how to control the object). Accordingly, the university students were divided into two groups to design activities, and finally the activities would be integrated to form a game and to become a part of the he kindergarten’s sport meeting, allowing the participation of 400 to 600 children and parents. For instance, if the results of drawing lots were running and throwing balls, the two activities of running and throwing balls would be integrated into one game.\n\nIn addition, the university students also needed to provide services for the next-door elderly center. Meanwhile, they had the opportunity to contact children and the elderly to compare how the children differed from the elderly in terms of muscle development and muscle movements."

This table listed the standard for each action, such as the standard of running skills and focusing skills. University students had to record whether children had reached the standard of each movement while observing. Therefore, in the sports meeting, university students not only helped facilitating the recording, but also had the opportunities to apply the contents learned in the class and observed the differences between children at different ages and differences between parents. Such reflection record enabled students to understand the muscle status of people at different ages."

Each group of students was required to submit a service activity proposal for the games and lesson plans they had designed. The event design must be completed within 6 weeks. Clear instructions and requirements made it easy for students to engage in. Professor Cheung also observed that students had better learning performance.\n\nUniversity students had to refer to a certain amount of academic literature references for the submission of a proposal. For example, students had to find four to six articles related o physical fitness and motor development for adults. Studying the literature helped students in their design of service activities and understanding of the contents, difficulties, materials and safety concerns of various games."

Therefore, if students were absent, their scores would be deducted by 5 points as punishment. In group tasks, in order to promote all group members to engage in group activities, Professor Cheung added a best team member award and if 50% or more of the team members thought that one student was the best team member, that student could have extra points. Accordingly, “worst team member” was also set up that if one team member was rated as the worst team member by 50% or more team members, she would deduct a certain point from his/her scores. The purpose of peer evaluation was to enhance university students’ engagement into the group activities, but the deduction was not an end in itself. In the past, Professor Cheung would have a separate meeting with the students who were selected as the worst team members to understand their situation and give reminders. In this case, the students’ scores would be deducted by 0.5 points. Although the deduction was not much, it allowed students to be aware of their own shortcomings in order to improve their behaviors. Furthermore, Professor Cheung also requested students to report the group’s assignment as well as the proportion of each task. Students needed to sign their names to acknowledge that everyone was satisfied with the division of labor. This approach helped to promote students’ responsibilities and engagement.\n\nAfter completing the service activities, the university students needed to finish individual reports. The purpose of this homework was to remind students to carefully observe the physical and motor skills of the elderly during the service process. This observation was related to the literature assigned for reading by the students in the previous homework. For example, if a student selected the literature about physical strength of the elderly to review, he/she should observe the corresponding targeted service recipients in the activities and record the observations so as to distinguish between the elderly and the children."

The time for each student to interact with the elderly had decreased when the pairing ratio changed from 1:1 to 1:2, which also affected the atmosphere of the service activities.\n\nThe university has begun to provide small grants for service learning courses, and senior students or graduates can be invited to provide advice and support on the service site, or to complete in-depth interviews to help improve the course. However, the core work, such as the communication and coordination with the organization, must be carried out by the teachers themselves.

        content: "Case 4 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled “Community Engagement through Service-Learning” (Hereinafter referred to as Community). This course was offered by Ms. CHAN, Wing-yee, Constance, she is from Lingnan University.\n\nThe course Community has been set up for more than four years. Different from other service- learning courses, Ms. Chan’s course was centered on the concept and practice of service learning. The course aims to enhance students’ self-understanding and the understanding of community through various interactive teaching and learning activities. This course provides an introduction to, and overview of, S-L theory and practice, the institutions of welfare and service providers, and the emergence of social enterprises as well as local and global social and environmental issues. Students have the opportunity for hands-on service project designed by themselves under the guidance of the course instructors and/or community supervisor(s). Through the group project, students have the chance to understand a specific community and meet the community needs, and think critically about the issues involved. The course also help students understand the importance of reflection and ways of doing it effectively. Students are expected to learn autonomously, and to collaborate with their fellows, alongside regular supervision by the instructors.\n\nFor classroom learning, Ms. Chan introduced different aspects of service learning which included the historical background, theory, assessment methods, research skills, and methods for assessing community needs. According to specific service recipients and service activities at each semester, the instructor would introduce and discuss related social issues in the classroom. For example, some organizations focused more on the topic of dementia for the elderly. Then, in class, more discussion were tailored for exploring aging issues. For service projects related to the grass-root life of the society, the social issues, for example, poverty, global citizens and even social entrepreneurship companies would be explored. Students had the opportunity to delve into these issues, and learn more about how different organizations and groups responded to these issues.\n\nThe instructor took students to different communities to understand the needs of the service recipients and then designed specific service learning projects/activities to meet the needs of the society. Different from other service-learning courses, the course Communty was more flexible in the development and selection of the service organizations. The instructor also had the opportunity to find cooperative organizations based on her personal background, expertise, and relationships with the organizations. Ms. Chan has a social work background, which makes her focus more on specific issues in the society, such as poverty and women. When searching for organizations, Ms. Chan hopes to extend the scope of Lingnan University’s existing service activities and also discuss possible service activities with the existing partner organizations."

For example, partner organizations were working on food collection or women’s empowerment activities. The instructor would give introduction to students about women’s empowerment and the interested students could form a group and went to the center to learn more about the organizations and service recipients in the community and their specific needs.

This helps promote collaborations in alignment with the course requirements and maintain good and daily communication. Both parties would be more active in collaborations and would reach agreements more easily for service projects.\n\nOn the contrary, when universities and organizations do not have sufficient trust and understanding, to ensure the effectiveness of the service activities, additional manpower is often required. As a result, too much resources are invested and this affects subsequent cooperation. For instance, Ms. Chan worked with a center which serves cancer patients, and the center wanted university students to help members write their life stories. The center had high expectations for story writing. As it was unsure whether the university students could complete the story writing with satisfaction, a clinic psychologist was arranged to cooperate with the students to edit, interview and follow up the writing of each story. In the end, although the center was satisfied with the story, the overloaded manpower and massive time investment suspended the follow-up cooperation. If the two parties had a better understanding with each other beforehand, it would be better for them to have a clear understanding of their inputs and expectations before cooperation."

She often facilitated students’ reflection through art activities. For example, in a reflection meeting, she firstly gave students pieces of paper and magazines, and then facilitated students’ reflection and writing with three questions. Students had to choose one color to represent their feeling of participating in the service activity. Students would also choose from the magazines and materials provided the social issues observed from the community and to give suggestions for improving the service activities. Students within their groups could share and further discuss according to their own paintings.\n\nIn addition, at the beginning of each lesson, students reported project progress. The instructor and the other groups of students gave feedback. In Ms. Chan’s view, the service activities of each group were not the activities of individuals but the whole class. That is, each group’s sharing allowed the other groups of students to give suggestion and advice. When a group needed help, other groups of the students could provide assistance. These promoted the atmosphere of mutual support, leading to the common objective of service-learning. During this process, students had the opportunity to learn from each other and found out they could be complementary to each other with their own strengths and weaknesses. This process facilitated students’ abilities to seek help, cooperate with others and solve problems. For example, when a group of students completed a women-related service activity, they considered whether they could launch a “community kitchen” activity which would be inviting women to cook with the university students in the service activity. During the planning process for the event, Ms. Chan found that it was not easy to find a venue suitable for dozens of people. With responsible students in class mentioned this need, everyone discussed the suitable venues together, and came up with a study room ran by students. Therefore, some students continued to look for the person-in-charge to discuss the feasibility. During this process, the whole class tried to explore different resources and completed an activity."

When students participated in a group in handling service activities, they saw that many students were active and engaged. During this process, students observed each other and heard stories of different service recipients. Many interpersonal interactive situations affected students, allowing them to know more about themselves, the society, and the service recipients. This process of continuously understanding and discovery strengthen the power to change students. Many students often mentioned at the last sharing session that they found out that instead of serving others, they were actually served by others. Students had not thought that many could learn many things from the women and the elderly. In addition, they could not ever thought that they had to face issues in their twenties and had not considered the value of the family.

Social workers were well aware of the focus of the course, and they could play the roles of co-educators to help students sort out and deepen their experience in service activates. It was more effective for the social workers in the organization to point out the free-riders or students’ poor performance because the social workers directly expressed their expectations and unsatisfactory work areas.
