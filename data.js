          "Case 1 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled “Promotion of Children and Adolescent Development” (Hereinafter referred to as Children). This course was offered by Dr. YU Lu, she is from the department of Applied Social Sciences of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nThe course expects students to be able to 1) critically examine the different perspectives of child and adolescent development and apply the concepts in understanding the needs and potentials of underprivileged children and adolescents in the community, 2) integrate knowledge on child and adolescent development into real life situations through service delivery, 3) apply the discipline specific knowledge and skills (such as engagement and communication skills with children and adolescents) to deal with complex issues in the service setting, 4) reflect on their roles and responsibilities both as a professional in their chosen discipline and as a responsible citizen, 5) cultivate the positive values and strengths orientation, 6) cultivate civic responsibilities and prosocial behaviors, 7) develop the sense of care and compassion towards other people, especially the underprivileged children and adolescents in the community, 8) enhance self-confidence, problem solving and decision-making capabilities, 9) enhance the social competence and interpersonal skills through collaboration with the partners, partnered agencies, parents and service targets.\n\nThe course Children runs across two semesters - spring semester and summer semester. In the spring semester, students were required to complete a 10-hour online course on basic concepts and practice of service-learning, such as principles, concepts and research of service-learning), benefits of service-learning to the service users, the community, the students and the university, the ethical issues, effective teamwork and problem solving skills in service-learning, reflection as a tool for learning discipline-specific concepts.\n\nIn the spring semester, the course also included one lesson on the course content and three lessons on theories related to the development of children and adolescents. Each lesson lasted for three hours, including 1) lectures and seminars for acquiring discipline-specific knowledge, including developmental theories of child and adolescent development, ecological model of human development, positive youth development model, the strengths model of intervention, 3) seminars for equipping themselves with the project-specific skills such as engagement and communication skills of children and adolescents, ways to promote their competence, assessment of child and adolescent development, generic service planning, delivery and evaluation etc., 4) small group discussion and workshops for students to develop a service curriculum for the underprivileged children and adolescents, to share moral and ethical issues, service delivery skills and classroom management and through which students develop their teamwork capability. At the workshops about service activities, the course instructors guided the university students as to how to design instructional programs and to acquire basic teaching skills. For example, there would be lesson on how to stimulate primary school students’ interest and motivation in learning and on strategies to engage them in classroom learning. The university students were free to choose specific teaching topics based on their experiences and interests.\n\nAfter that, they joined a 10-day tour and complete a service-learning project in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xi’an in Mainland China. During these ten days’ period, they have preparations before service in the first two days, and then the service activities were held in a primary school in the next five days. The day after the service activities, the course instructors organized the sixth workshop to help students consolidate what they had learned. Upon returning to Hong Kong, the students were also required to have a group presentation at their final workshop."

              "For running this Children course, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) cooperated with Zhejiang University in Mainland China to launch the service activities in a primary school in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. The primary school was set up by the local government mainly for the migrant children who were born elsewhere in China and their parents were working in Hangzhou.\n\nThe students from the PolyU who took the Children course traveled to Hangzhou during the summer semester and provided a five-day service in the primary school. They were mainly engaged in teaching activities for the primary school students. During the service period, the research students of Zhejiang University participated in classroom observation and group discussions after class, and shared their observations and opinions.\n\nThis Children course emphasized rich and effective communication with the service partner. The counterparts of Zhejiang University initially made contact with the primary school. After the clarifications of the cooperation intention and before meeting directly with partners in the primary school, the course instructors sent the service plan to the school principal for advice and suggestions. The service plan covered:\n- What did the PolyU plan to do?\n- Whether the expectations and proposed service arrangement of the PolyU were reasonable?\n- In the opinion of the primary school, was it appropriate to do so?\n- Could it be achieved in the current school environment?\n- What were the expectations of the primary school from PolyU and Zhejiang University, for example, about the topics and content that would be taught by the university students?\n\nThe course instructors asked the opinions of the school partners about the following four themes: interesting science, health promotion, personal development, interesting daily English and their expectations on the theme-related contents and their corresponding proportions, and then made revisions accordingly. After reviewing the service plan, the school partners accepted and recognized the concept of service-learning, and expressed confidence in the enthusiasm and attitude of the university students. Through this active communication, the school partners felt being respected. With a good understanding of the service details and with their opinions being addressed, the partners would be more willing to cooperate.\n\nDuring the service period, the collaborating parties had to handle conflicts and keep maintaining a good understanding of each other. The PolyU hoped that the university students could play a leading role in class management. At the beginning, the head teachers worried that the university students could not manage the class effectively, so they often entered the classrooms to intervene the class activities and to discipline the school children. It was found that whenever the head teachers appeared, the school children would follow directly the instructions of them, and the performance of university students was hence restricted. During the learning process, the head teachers thought that the class was too messy while the university students regarded that the head teachers were too strict.\n\nTo enhance mutual understanding, the course instructors of PolyU invited the head teachers to participate in the reflective meeting every afternoon to share their observations and concerns. The university students would also explain to the head teachers their interactive teaching methods and their views on the noisy class. Gradually, with more understanding, the head teachers finally intervened less in the following year. During the preparation stage, the course instructors also guided the university students to understand the cultural differences between the two places and expected them to try their best to seek the help of the head teachers so that their service activities could be completed at the scheduled service period.\n\nAt the beginning of the third year, the collaboration became smooth. The head teachers finally showed their confidence in the university students and they did not observe the class teaching daily. Instead, they would meet the university students first to introduce the class information as well as the characteristics of the primary school students. The university students could also easily make contact with them in their office in case of need. There would be regular reflective meetings at the end of the service day. The collaboration model between the two parties was finally well established after this active communication and mutual adjustment process.\n\nWhen the service period of the year ended, the PolyU and the service partners in China maintained their contacts with each other through different means.\n\n<b><i>Sharing students’ learning outcomes.</i></b> The primary school invited a local TV station to film a graduation ceremony at the end of the service period and had it broadcasted as news. The school shared the information with the course instructors of PolyU and the information could be used in teaching in the coming year. The PolyU also shared with the school the videos and photos taken during the service period, which were about progress and outcomes of the teaching activities as well as the reflective meetings.\n\n<b><i>Invitation to conference.</i></b> When a paper, based on the data collected for this service-learning course in the first year of collaboration, was written by the course instructors of the PolyU and was accepted for presentation at a conference, the service partners were also invited to attend the conference. This helped to improve mutual understanding and contact between them.\n\n<b><i>Establish personal relationship.</i></b> At the same time, some personal relationships were also developed and they would update each other. A trusting collaborating relationship was gradually established and sustained among the service partners."

            text:
              "In the first year, about 40 students from the PolyU participated in the Children course. Two course instructors jointly led the university students to Hangzhou. As a result, with the positive learning experiences and outcomes of students, the primary school expected that the PolyU would continue to provide service activities in the second year and was willing to develop a long-term cooperative partnership. Therefore, the PolyU organized two classes with about 80 students in the following year. In addition, there were two more course instructors and one project assistant. Finally, a total of 5 colleagues (4 course instructors and 1 project assistant) led about 80 university students to Hangzhou. The four course instructors provided guidance to the university students while the project assistant was responsible for handling administrative matters. The university students formed teams of 4 and 5 students each and each team would serve about twenty primary school students. The number of primary school students in the school also increased from around 200 in the first year to around 400.\n\nThe increase of the class size brought new challenges to the collaborating parties. The primary school required more support, for example, in handling meals and maintaining the hygiene conditions. At the same time, there were problems to resolve. When the primary school students faced problems, they would normally approach the school principal or head teachers for help instead of discussing with the university students there in the class first. For example, for late delivery of lunch boxes to a class while the students from other classes had already started eating, some school students would cry and go to find the principal directly.\n\nThe increase in class size also caused more accidents. The course instructors also encountered problems. On one occasion, one of them had an urgent health issue and had to go back to Hong Kong early. The course instructors had to deal with the manpower allocation among them timely at that time. Thereafter, the class size was maintained to be 80 and in two large classes. The two large classes formed 4 small groups of 20 students each. This 20 students’ group size was more suitable for a course instructor to observe and supervise."

          "At the time of design, the course instructor of Children paid close attention to the students’ opportunities to apply their knowledge acquired during lessons in the service activities arranged for the service targets. If the two (curriculum and services) are out of touch of each other, the students would think that the previous learning in lessons was useless and the service activities were no different from ordinary volunteer activities.\n\nTo enhance the linkage between the curriculum and the services, the course instructors would introduce the characteristics of children and adolescents at their different stages of development in the spring semester. Students would also have the opportunity to develop appropriate teaching topics for the group’s teaching plan with the background theories they acquired during the lessons. For example, when the university students obtained the knowledge from the lectures that the children of middle childhood would be prone to accidents and in the choice of “health promotion” as the theme, the university students specifically chose the ‘Furniture Safety’ as the teaching topic so as to help school children to better protect themselves at home.\n\nAnother objective of the course is to develop students' teamwork abilities. Therefore, in the service activities, the university students formed into different groups, and each group would lead the service activities for 20 primary school students. There would be a team leader each time with the support of other student members of the team in guiding the children to participate in discussions and activities and in this regard, it was expected to enhance the university students’ abilities in teamwork, collaboration and communication.\n\nIn addition to the design phase, after the end of daily service activities, the course instructors also attached great importance to how to connect with the course content when leading reflection and discussion. The university students would be guided to respect the individual differences and diversity of children. In their practical teaching process, the students often encountered the different learning performances of children. For example, when learning English, some primary school children showed a high standard, but some only reached the entry level. The course instructors would provide specific advice on how to design tiered learning tasks and different levels of worksheet based on students’ abilities, and provide students with different scaffolding. At the same time, the instructors guided university students to understand the individual differences and diversity in the growth of children and adolescents and to take care of the diversity of children in the course of service activities."

They would meet the principal and teachers from the school to equip themselves with the general knowledge about the school and also the general characteristics of the school students. During the service time, the university students would encounter primary school children who needed special care. Therefore, when meeting the head teachers, the university students would emphasize the understanding of those children who needed special attention and how to deal with them\n\nIn addition to the understanding of the characteristics of the students before the start of the formal service activities, the course instructors also paid great attention to analyzing the characteristics and behaviors of the school students together with the university students in the daily reflective activities, especially about the school students who acted with rebellious behaviors, they would explore the causes of such behaviors, how their negative emotions were generated, and so on. This was very helpful for university students to deepen their understanding of the characteristics of primary school students."

With direct interactions with the school children, the university students were expected to develop their passion of caring towards the children and showed their empathy. For example, a girl in Dr. Yu’s class transformed herself from a girl who disliked children to one who would like to help them. She later joined a tour to Africa to help more children. She found that children were sincere though sometimes annoying."

For example, the course instructors had designed for lecture themes on interesting science, health promotion, personal development and interesting daily English. The university students could select their teaching topics from the four themes based on their own experiences and interests. The instructors would encourage students to select those themes related to their major study. For example, students whose major was in marketing and finance could choose to teach the primary school children how to manage their pocket money. Meanwhile, the instructors would organize workshops and helped the students to equip with teaching skills, such as how to engage primary school students in activities and how to improve their learning motivation.\n\nThe university students would also discuss with the instructors their lesson plans. With the guidance of the instructors, the students would adjust their teaching plans taking into consideration the development level of the primary school students and the different learning context of Mainland China.\n\nAfter the completion of writing a teaching plan, the university students would discuss with the instructors how much the plan was suitable for the development level of the primary school students and whether the content was suitable for presentation in the context of the Mainland China. For example, the Children class will cover knowledge about physical development. Based on the learning need of the upper primary school students, the university students plan to explore topics about sex education. The instructors then explained to the university students about the social background of Mainland China, the general views of people on sex education, and suggested the extent that it could be talked about. With the feedback from the instructors, the students would revise their teaching plans. In this process, the instructors would provide guidance only and would not revise the lesson plans for the students directly"

Before the service activities, the instructors will introduce the theories and the students will have self-reflections on their personal growth experience. In the workshops, the instructors will guide students to apply skills acquired in lessons in classroom management as well as drawing the attention of participants in class. The instructors will present specific situations and questions and help students to learn through case study in which the students discuss for solutions to problematic situations. The instructors observe that after continuous reflection activities, students would use what they have learned to analyze problems and reflect on their personal learning in the process of offering service.\n\nDuring the service activities in Hangzhou, the course instructors, students from PolyU and Zhejiang University participated in reflection meetings at the end of daily activities, and the primary school teachers would sometimes participate. The students were more willing to share true feelings and reflect on themselves in a learning environment where there were sincere expression, mutual trust, supportive and safe atmosphere. Each student would talk about their teaching process in class and reflect on their own performance and difficulties at the service activities. They also shared how to get along with the children. In addition to the positive learning, all parties involved would also share their weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n\nIn the reflection meetings, the research students from Zhejiang University acted as observers and they would share what they had seen at the teaching sessions. With reference to how the university students took care of different physical and psychological needs of the school children, the course instructors designed a classroom observation sheet. Prior to taking up their observation role, they would be required to attend a workshop on how to use the observations sheet, about the principles of recording, and about how to give positive encouragement and constructive opinions when making comments on students’ performance. Although the results would not be taken into account as assessment scores, the use of observation sheet can help students structure their observation content, follow the proper observation principles, give helpful opinions and suggestions during the reflection meeting. The course instructors find that the comments are very helpful for the improvement in the teaching process and therefore, accordingly, students can usually make timely adjustment in the coming service sessions.\n\nTo overcome the challenges and difficulties raised by the students and the observers, the instructors would provide timely feedback and suggestions, for example, on how to talk with and get along with the children. For problems which cannot be resolved immediately, the students will be provided with some principles to understand the problems at that time. When some individual students have emotional issue, the instructors would follow up and offer personal support. For example, the PolyU students pointed out the variations in the educational methods between Mainland China and Hong Kong as teachers in China put emphasis on students’ disciplines in class and had strict rules. Accordingly, the PolyU students would express their views and discuss how to use interactive methods during the lessons."

              "Service-learning is different from traditional teaching. This requires the instructor to recognize the concept of service-learning and to believe that it can have a positive impact on students’ learning. It also requires the instructor to have a concrete and thorough understanding of the characteristics of service-learning. In addition, the subject instructors also need to invest more time and energy to deal with matters related to other stakeholders, for example, students and other service partners. The course instructors also need to provide students additional guidance to the design and running of service plans with the service partners and recipients. Therefore, the course instructors also need to spend time on understanding thoroughly the expectations and needs of the service partners.\n\nFor Children course, at the preparation stage prior to the service activities, the course instructors provided guidance and support to students, which included the guidance about the design of the teaching plans. For example, the course instructors would advise to adjust the level of content difficulty when it was found that the primary school students might find it hard to understand. The course instructors would also advise whether the selected topic was suitable for Mainland students, and would give suggestions how the university students could revise the plan according to the background and context of the primary school. For example, a group of students designed topics related to sex education. The course instructors would explain the differences between the mainland and Hong Kong regarding the physical health and sex education for primary school students, and would advise the university students how to revise the teaching plans and methods. With reference to the instructor's opinions, the students revised their teaching plans.\n\nFor another example, the Children course focused on promoting positive youth development. Understanding and respecting the diversity of students is one of the important principles. In the process of instructing university students to design teaching plans and in their teaching practice, the course instructors paid much attention to guiding university students to take care of the diversity of students. If some students did not keep up with the progress, the instructors would make specific suggestions on how to set up layered content and coursework. In the implementation process, the diversity of school children was also taken into consideration, and different kinds of support and help would be provided to the children with respect to their differences in their participation in activities.\n\nWhen the service activities formally begin, the university students will encounter some unforeseen challenges and their emotions will fluctuate. The course instructors would pay great attention to provide emotional support to students. They would observe the performance and improvement of university students in their attitudes, engagement levels, and caring of students. The instructors would recognize the strengths of students and proposed improvement suggestions. The instructors observed that when university students were positively encouraged, they were often more willing to take the initiative to improve the teaching plans and considered multiple strategies to improve the learning effectiveness of primary school students. For example, on the first day of teaching, usually everyone was frustrated. The instructor would focus on giving emotional support to university students, telling them that the performance on the first day was not the most important. The instructors was more concerned with the time and energy the university students had put in the whole service, their attitude towards service activities, their caring of the primary school students, and the improvement of the university students in the process. The instructors recognized the strengths of the university students and pointed out their areas for improvement. This encouraged the university students to be willing to take the initiative to change themselves, revise their plans, and consider using various strategies to get along with the primary school students.\n\nIn addition, for service activities to be conducted well, it depends very much on good a collaborative relationship between the university and the community. The performance of university students in service activities has become a critical factor for the establishment of this relationship and therefore, the instructors will pay more attention to the performance of university students. As a compulsory course for all undergraduate students, the participating students’ are having diverse backgrounds and learning motives. For example, some university students were less participative at the beginning of the course and they just wanted to meet basic course requirements. With regard to past experience, when university students were in direct contact with primary school students, they often changed their views on service activities. Therefore, the course instructors would be attentive in provision of timely and relevant guidance to guide students to understand the meaning and functions of service activities. The good news is that the learning motives of university students will often be positively cultivated in this service-learning process."

In addition, the course instructors would also invite the principal of the primary school and the head teachers of each class to fill out a questionnaire to evaluate the performance of the students from the PolyU.\n\nIn addition to the questionnaire, the course instructors will review the effectiveness of the entire service activity with the principal and all the head teachers after each service event. According to the opinions of the principal and the teachers, the instructors will make adjustments in the teaching arrangements for the next year. For example, in the first year, a head teacher in charge of a class mentioned about health issues which would pose a safety hazard. Therefore, in the workshops held in the next year, the instructors increased the sanitation treatment in the class management, prompting the university students how to arrange student-on-duty daily and how to check the doors and windows. After making the corresponding adjustments, the primary school teachers felt very satisfied in the next year.\n\nThe course instructors also received feedback from other research projects. For example, another research team at the PolyU also visited the school of the Children course. Colleagues from the research team shared the results with the course instructors. The research team mentioned that some students mentioned that the 5-day service activities were always carried out in the school. It becomes a little bit boring, and the university students lack both the understanding of local culture and the opportunity of cultural exchange with local people. The course instructors listened to the opinion and made adjustments in the service arrangement for the next year, making 4 days as teaching days and 1 day as cultural day. In the morning of the cultural day, the university students of led the primary school students to visit a museum near the school, and they shared several topics in the afternoon, for example, the impressive things in the exhibition in the museum. The primary school students introduced the things that represent Hangzhou culture. The university students introduced the culture of their hometown. Both the students from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Zhejiang University students shared something about the cultures of their hometown. The primary school students brought something from home and explained it with their personal stories. This sharing activity allowed students of the PolyU to gain a rich understanding of primary school students and local culture within a short period of time."

          "It is a compulsory requirement for every student of the PolyU to complete a service-learning course which carries 3 credits. Although the students can have different choices, for those students with low interest in service-learning, their motivation and service performance will be unsatisfactory. From the experience of the course instructors, if the instructor can help some of these students to be properly prepared, give appropriate guidance in the process of learning and service, the students will learn and make a change. However, there are also some students who are more difficult to change. They always regard the service as an activity that they are forced to complete. They would only invest the least time and effort into it and it is difficult for teachers and students to communicate in depth.\n\nThe two-semester course schedule also has certain limitations too. Since some of the theories are taught in the spring semester, some of the content has been forgotten when students start to participate in the workshop during the summer. Therefore, some students suggest the arrangement of all the content to be taught before the summer semester."

          "Case 1 reports a three-credit service-learning course titled “Promotion of Children and Adolescent Development” (Hereinafter referred to as Children). This course was offered by Dr. YU Lu, she is from the department of Applied Social Sciences of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nThe course expects students to be able to 1) critically examine the different perspectives of child and adolescent development and apply the concepts in understanding the needs and potentials of underprivileged children and adolescents in the community, 2) integrate knowledge on child and adolescent development into real life situations through service delivery, 3) apply the discipline specific knowledge and skills (such as engagement and communication skills with children and adolescents) to deal with complex issues in the service setting, 4) reflect on their roles and responsibilities both as a professional in their chosen discipline and as a responsible citizen, 5) cultivate the positive values and strengths orientation, 6) cultivate civic responsibilities and prosocial behaviors, 7) develop the sense of care and compassion towards other people, especially the underprivileged children and adolescents in the community, 8) enhance self-confidence, problem solving and decision-making capabilities, 9) enhance the social competence and interpersonal skills through collaboration with the partners, partnered agencies, parents and service targets.\n\nThe course Children runs across two semesters - spring semester and summer semester. In the spring semester, students were required to complete a 10-hour online course on basic concepts and practice of service-learning, such as principles, concepts and research of service-learning), benefits of service-learning to the service users, the community, the students and the university, the ethical issues, effective teamwork and problem solving skills in service-learning, reflection as a tool for learning discipline-specific concepts.\n\nIn the spring semester, the course also included one lesson on the course content and three lessons on theories related to the development of children and adolescents. Each lesson lasted for three hours, including 1) lectures and seminars for acquiring discipline-specific knowledge, including developmental theories of child and adolescent development, ecological model of human development, positive youth development model, the strengths model of intervention, 3) seminars for equipping themselves with the project-specific skills such as engagement and communication skills of children and adolescents, ways to promote their competence, assessment of child and adolescent development, generic service planning, delivery and evaluation etc., 4) small group discussion and workshops for students to develop a service curriculum for the underprivileged children and adolescents, to share moral and ethical issues, service delivery skills and classroom management and through which students develop their teamwork capability. At the workshops about service activities, the course instructors guided the university students as to how to design instructional programs and to acquire basic teaching skills. For example, there would be lesson on how to stimulate primary school students’ interest and motivation in learning and on strategies to engage them in classroom learning. The university students were free to choose specific teaching topics based on their experiences and interests.\n\nAfter that, they joined a 10-day tour and complete a service-learning project in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xi’an in Mainland China. During these ten days’ period, they have preparations before service in the first two days, and then the service activities were held in a primary school in the next five days. The day after the service activities, the course instructors organized the sixth workshop to help students consolidate what they had learned. Upon returning to Hong Kong, the students were also required to have a group presentation at their final workshop."

              "For running this Children course, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) cooperated with Zhejiang University in Mainland China to launch the service activities in a primary school in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. The primary school was set up by the local government mainly for the migrant children who were born elsewhere in China and their parents were working in Hangzhou.\n\nThe students from the PolyU who took the Children course traveled to Hangzhou during the summer semester and provided a five-day service in the primary school. They were mainly engaged in teaching activities for the primary school students. During the service period, the research students of Zhejiang University participated in classroom observation and group discussions after class, and shared their observations and opinions.\n\nThis Children course emphasized rich and effective communication with the service partner. The counterparts of Zhejiang University initially made contact with the primary school. After the clarifications of the cooperation intention and before meeting directly with partners in the primary school, the course instructors sent the service plan to the school principal for advice and suggestions. The service plan covered:\n- What did the PolyU plan to do?\n- Whether the expectations and proposed service arrangement of the PolyU were reasonable?\n- In the opinion of the primary school, was it appropriate to do so?\n- Could it be achieved in the current school environment?\n- What were the expectations of the primary school from PolyU and Zhejiang University, for example, about the topics and content that would be taught by the university students?\n\nThe course instructors asked the opinions of the school partners about the following four themes: interesting science, health promotion, personal development, interesting daily English and their expectations on the theme-related contents and their corresponding proportions, and then made revisions accordingly. After reviewing the service plan, the school partners accepted and recognized the concept of service-learning, and expressed confidence in the enthusiasm and attitude of the university students. Through this active communication, the school partners felt being respected. With a good understanding of the service details and with their opinions being addressed, the partners would be more willing to cooperate.\n\nDuring the service period, the collaborating parties had to handle conflicts and keep maintaining a good understanding of each other. The PolyU hoped that the university students could play a leading role in class management. At the beginning, the head teachers worried that the university students could not manage the class effectively, so they often entered the classrooms to intervene the class activities and to discipline the school children. It was found that whenever the head teachers appeared, the school children would follow directly the instructions of them, and the performance of university students was hence restricted. During the learning process, the head teachers thought that the class was too messy while the university students regarded that the head teachers were too strict.\n\nTo enhance mutual understanding, the course instructors of PolyU invited the head teachers to participate in the reflective meeting every afternoon to share their observations and concerns. The university students would also explain to the head teachers their interactive teaching methods and their views on the noisy class. Gradually, with more understanding, the head teachers finally intervened less in the following year. During the preparation stage, the course instructors also guided the university students to understand the cultural differences between the two places and expected them to try their best to seek the help of the head teachers so that their service activities could be completed at the scheduled service period.\n\nAt the beginning of the third year, the collaboration became smooth. The head teachers finally showed their confidence in the university students and they did not observe the class teaching daily. Instead, they would meet the university students first to introduce the class information as well as the characteristics of the primary school students. The university students could also easily make contact with them in their office in case of need. There would be regular reflective meetings at the end of the service day. The collaboration model between the two parties was finally well established after this active communication and mutual adjustment process.\n\nWhen the service period of the year ended, the PolyU and the service partners in China maintained their contacts with each other through different means.\n\n<b><i>Sharing students’ learning outcomes.</i></b> The primary school invited a local TV station to film a graduation ceremony at the end of the service period and had it broadcasted as news. The school shared the information with the course instructors of PolyU and the information could be used in teaching in the coming year. The PolyU also shared with the school the videos and photos taken during the service period, which were about progress and outcomes of the teaching activities as well as the reflective meetings.\n\n<b><i>Invitation to conference.</i></b> When a paper, based on the data collected for this service-learning course in the first year of collaboration, was written by the course instructors of the PolyU and was accepted for presentation at a conference, the service partners were also invited to attend the conference. This helped to improve mutual understanding and contact between them.\n\n<b><i>Establish personal relationship.</i></b> At the same time, some personal relationships were also developed and they would update each other. A trusting collaborating relationship was gradually established and sustained among the service partners."

            text:
              "In the first year, about 40 students from the PolyU participated in the Children course. Two course instructors jointly led the university students to Hangzhou. As a result, with the positive learning experiences and outcomes of students, the primary school expected that the PolyU would continue to provide service activities in the second year and was willing to develop a long-term cooperative partnership. Therefore, the PolyU organized two classes with about 80 students in the following year. In addition, there were two more course instructors and one project assistant. Finally, a total of 5 colleagues (4 course instructors and 1 project assistant) led about 80 university students to Hangzhou. The four course instructors provided guidance to the university students while the project assistant was responsible for handling administrative matters. The university students formed teams of 4 and 5 students each and each team would serve about twenty primary school students. The number of primary school students in the school also increased from around 200 in the first year to around 400.\n\nThe increase of the class size brought new challenges to the collaborating parties. The primary school required more support, for example, in handling meals and maintaining the hygiene conditions. At the same time, there were problems to resolve. When the primary school students faced problems, they would normally approach the school principal or head teachers for help instead of discussing with the university students there in the class first. For example, for late delivery of lunch boxes to a class while the students from other classes had already started eating, some school students would cry and go to find the principal directly.\n\nThe increase in class size also caused more accidents. The course instructors also encountered problems. On one occasion, one of them had an urgent health issue and had to go back to Hong Kong early. The course instructors had to deal with the manpower allocation among them timely at that time. Thereafter, the class size was maintained to be 80 and in two large classes. The two large classes formed 4 small groups of 20 students each. This 20 students’ group size was more suitable for a course instructor to observe and supervise."

          "At the time of design, the course instructor of Children paid close attention to the students’ opportunities to apply their knowledge acquired during lessons in the service activities arranged for the service targets. If the two (curriculum and services) are out of touch of each other, the students would think that the previous learning in lessons was useless and the service activities were no different from ordinary volunteer activities.\n\nTo enhance the linkage between the curriculum and the services, the course instructors would introduce the characteristics of children and adolescents at their different stages of development in the spring semester. Students would also have the opportunity to develop appropriate teaching topics for the group’s teaching plan with the background theories they acquired during the lessons. For example, when the university students obtained the knowledge from the lectures that the children of middle childhood would be prone to accidents and in the choice of “health promotion” as the theme, the university students specifically chose the ‘Furniture Safety’ as the teaching topic so as to help school children to better protect themselves at home.\n\nAnother objective of the course is to develop students' teamwork abilities. Therefore, in the service activities, the university students formed into different groups, and each group would lead the service activities for 20 primary school students. There would be a team leader each time with the support of other student members of the team in guiding the children to participate in discussions and activities and in this regard, it was expected to enhance the university students’ abilities in teamwork, collaboration and communication.\n\nIn addition to the design phase, after the end of daily service activities, the course instructors also attached great importance to how to connect with the course content when leading reflection and discussion. The university students would be guided to respect the individual differences and diversity of children. In their practical teaching process, the students often encountered the different learning performances of children. For example, when learning English, some primary school children showed a high standard, but some only reached the entry level. The course instructors would provide specific advice on how to design tiered learning tasks and different levels of worksheet based on students’ abilities, and provide students with different scaffolding. At the same time, the instructors guided university students to understand the individual differences and diversity in the growth of children and adolescents and to take care of the diversity of children in the course of service activities."

During the service time, the university students would encounter primary school children who needed special care. Therefore, when meeting the head teachers, the university students would emphasize the understanding of those children who needed special attention and how to deal with them\n\nIn addition to the understanding of the characteristics of the students before the start of the formal service activities, the course instructors also paid great attention to analyzing the characteristics and behaviors of the school students together with the university students in the daily reflective activities, especially about the school students who acted with rebellious behaviors, they would explore the causes of such behaviors, how their negative emotions were generated, and so on.

With direct interactions with the school children, the university students were expected to develop their passion of caring towards the children and showed their empathy. For example, a girl in Dr. Yu’s class transformed herself from a girl who disliked children to one who would like to help them. She later joined a tour to Africa to help more children.

The university students could select their teaching topics from the four themes based on their own experiences and interests. The instructors would encourage students to select those themes related to their major study. For example, students whose major was in marketing and finance could choose to teach the primary school children how to manage their pocket money. Meanwhile, the instructors would organize workshops and helped the students to equip with teaching skills, such as how to engage primary school students in activities and how to improve their learning motivation.\n\nThe university students would also discuss with the instructors their lesson plans. With the guidance of the instructors, the students would adjust their teaching plans taking into consideration the development level of the primary school students and the different learning context of Mainland China.\n\nAfter the completion of writing a teaching plan, the university students would discuss with the instructors how much the plan was suitable for the development level of the primary school students and whether the content was suitable for presentation in the context of the Mainland China. For example, the Children class will cover knowledge about physical development. Based on the learning need of the upper primary school students, the university students plan to explore topics about sex education. The instructors then explained to the university students about the social background of Mainland China, the general views of people on sex education, and suggested the extent that it could be talked about. With the feedback from the instructors, the students would revise their teaching plans. In this process, the instructors would provide guidance only and would not revise the lesson plans for the students directly"

Before the service activities, the instructors will introduce the theories and the students will have self-reflections on their personal growth experience. In the workshops, the instructors will guide students to apply skills acquired in lessons in classroom management as well as drawing the attention of participants in class. The instructors will present specific situations and questions and help students to learn through case study in which the students discuss for solutions to problematic situations. The instructors observe that after continuous reflection activities, students would use what they have learned to analyze problems and reflect on their personal learning in the process of offering service.\n\nDuring the service activities in Hangzhou, the course instructors, students from PolyU and Zhejiang University participated in reflection meetings at the end of daily activities, and the primary school teachers would sometimes participate. The students were more willing to share true feelings and reflect on themselves in a learning environment where there were sincere expression, mutual trust, supportive and safe atmosphere. Each student would talk about their teaching process in class and reflect on their own performance and difficulties at the service activities. They also shared how to get along with the children. In addition to the positive learning, all parties involved would also share their weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n\nIn the reflection meetings, the research students from Zhejiang University acted as observers and they would share what they had seen at the teaching sessions. With reference to how the university students took care of different physical and psychological needs of the school children, the course instructors designed a classroom observation sheet. Prior to taking up their observation role, they would be required to attend a workshop on how to use the observations sheet, about the principles of recording, and about how to give positive encouragement and constructive opinions when making comments on students’ performance. Although the results would not be taken into account as assessment scores, the use of observation sheet can help students structure their observation content, follow the proper observation principles, give helpful opinions and suggestions during the reflection meeting. The course instructors find that the comments are very helpful for the improvement in the teaching process and therefore, accordingly, students can usually make timely adjustment in the coming service sessions.\n\nTo overcome the challenges and difficulties raised by the students and the observers, the instructors would provide timely feedback and suggestions, for example, on how to talk with and get along with the children. For problems which cannot be resolved immediately, the students will be provided with some principles to understand the problems at that time. When some individual students have emotional issue, the instructors would follow up and offer personal support. For example, the PolyU students pointed out the variations in the educational methods between Mainland China and Hong Kong as teachers in China put emphasis on students’ disciplines in class and had strict rules. Accordingly, the PolyU students would express their views and discuss how to use interactive methods during the lessons."

              "Service-learning is different from traditional teaching. This requires the instructor to recognize the concept of service-learning and to believe that it can have a positive impact on students’ learning. It also requires the instructor to have a concrete and thorough understanding of the characteristics of service-learning. In addition, the subject instructors also need to invest more time and energy to deal with matters related to other stakeholders, for example, students and other service partners. The course instructors also need to provide students additional guidance to the design and running of service plans with the service partners and recipients. Therefore, the course instructors also need to spend time on understanding thoroughly the expectations and needs of the service partners.\n\nFor Children course, at the preparation stage prior to the service activities, the course instructors provided guidance and support to students, which included the guidance about the design of the teaching plans. For example, the course instructors would advise to adjust the level of content difficulty when it was found that the primary school students might find it hard to understand. The course instructors would also advise whether the selected topic was suitable for Mainland students, and would give suggestions how the university students could revise the plan according to the background and context of the primary school. For example, a group of students designed topics related to sex education. The course instructors would explain the differences between the mainland and Hong Kong regarding the physical health and sex education for primary school students, and would advise the university students how to revise the teaching plans and methods. With reference to the instructor's opinions, the students revised their teaching plans.\n\nFor another example, the Children course focused on promoting positive youth development. Understanding and respecting the diversity of students is one of the important principles. In the process of instructing university students to design teaching plans and in their teaching practice, the course instructors paid much attention to guiding university students to take care of the diversity of students. If some students did not keep up with the progress, the instructors would make specific suggestions on how to set up layered content and coursework. In the implementation process, the diversity of school children was also taken into consideration, and different kinds of support and help would be provided to the children with respect to their differences in their participation in activities.\n\nWhen the service activities formally begin, the university students will encounter some unforeseen challenges and their emotions will fluctuate. The course instructors would pay great attention to provide emotional support to students. They would observe the performance and improvement of university students in their attitudes, engagement levels, and caring of students. The instructors would recognize the strengths of students and proposed improvement suggestions. The instructors observed that when university students were positively encouraged, they were often more willing to take the initiative to improve the teaching plans and considered multiple strategies to improve the learning effectiveness of primary school students. For example, on the first day of teaching, usually everyone was frustrated. The instructor would focus on giving emotional support to university students, telling them that the performance on the first day was not the most important. The instructors was more concerned with the time and energy the university students had put in the whole service, their attitude towards service activities, their caring of the primary school students, and the improvement of the university students in the process. The instructors recognized the strengths of the university students and pointed out their areas for improvement. This encouraged the university students to be willing to take the initiative to change themselves, revise their plans, and consider using various strategies to get along with the primary school students.\n\nIn addition, for service activities to be conducted well, it depends very much on good a collaborative relationship between the university and the community. The performance of university students in service activities has become a critical factor for the establishment of this relationship and therefore, the instructors will pay more attention to the performance of university students. As a compulsory course for all undergraduate students, the participating students’ are having diverse backgrounds and learning motives. For example, some university students were less participative at the beginning of the course and they just wanted to meet basic course requirements. With regard to past experience, when university students were in direct contact with primary school students, they often changed their views on service activities. Therefore, the course instructors would be attentive in provision of timely and relevant guidance to guide students to understand the meaning and functions of service activities. The good news is that the learning motives of university students will often be positively cultivated in this service-learning process."

In addition, the course instructors would also invite the principal of the primary school and the head teachers of each class to fill out a questionnaire to evaluate the performance of the students from the PolyU.\n\nIn addition to the questionnaire, the course instructors will review the effectiveness of the entire service activity with the principal and all the head teachers after each service event. According to the opinions of the principal and the teachers, the instructors will make adjustments in the teaching arrangements for the next year. For example, in the first year, a head teacher in charge of a class mentioned about health issues which would pose a safety hazard. Therefore, in the workshops held in the next year, the instructors increased the sanitation treatment in the class management, prompting the university students how to arrange student-on-duty daily and how to check the doors and windows. After making the corresponding adjustments, the primary school teachers felt very satisfied in the next year.\n\nThe course instructors also received feedback from other research projects. For example, another research team at the PolyU also visited the school of the Children course. Colleagues from the research team shared the results with the course instructors. The research team mentioned that some students mentioned that the 5-day service activities were always carried out in the school. It becomes a little bit boring, and the university students lack both the understanding of local culture and the opportunity of cultural exchange with local people. The course instructors listened to the opinion and made adjustments in the service arrangement for the next year, making 4 days as teaching days and 1 day as cultural day. In the morning of the cultural day, the university students of led the primary school students to visit a museum near the school, and they shared several topics in the afternoon, for example, the impressive things in the exhibition in the museum. The primary school students introduced the things that represent Hangzhou culture. The university students introduced the culture of their hometown. Both the students from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Zhejiang University students shared something about the cultures of their hometown. The primary school students brought something from home and explained it with their personal stories. This sharing activity allowed students of the PolyU to gain a rich understanding of primary school students and local culture within a short period of time."
